What. A. Week. 
<line break>
We start off week 4 with every team having registering at least one tally
in the W column. Last year, I believe, we went about a month before we 
could have said that. Mike found himself scrounging for enough points
late into Sunday to topple Strez. Darin and Chris were also neck and neck
throughout most of the week and their showdown ended with Darin finding 
one last gear at the very end. 
<line break>
Travis can thank Connor Mcdavid for his Sunday night heroics and for 
providing him with a heap of points, good enough to beat Ryan. And Nick
didn't have a whole lot to worry about as he cruised by Craig by about 60
points. 
<Line break>

<b> Strez </b> 
<line break>
<line break>
1. Despite the loss, Strez still finds himself ranked #1 in our league. 
His team was good enough to win, and likely would have had Nick Suzuki
had a more abundant schedule in week 3. Suzuki and the Habs only played
2 games in the matchup, gathering only 5 points. However, if he played 
maybe 1 or 2 more, like most teams, he would have been somewhat likely
put up enough points to best Mike. He averages 4.9 points a game. 
Furthermore, Thomas Tatar would have helped the cause as well. He averages 
about 4.2 points/game.
<line break>
2. Jamie Benn was left out of the lineup Sunday night. He put up 7 points
after returning from his injury. A missed opportunuty. 
<Line break>
3. Mackinnon's injury also probably didn't help. He suffered an LBI in 
the second period of his game Sunday evening. Mackinnon might have been
the difference maker for both Colorado and Strez. 
<Line break>
4. Matt Dumba also being placed on IR weakens Strez' team a smidge going
further. You hope he and Mackinnon have a speedy recovery. With Kucherov 
being out for the season, Strez is already out one big gun. Can he survive 
with more out? 
<Line break>
<Line break>
<b>Travis </b>
<Line break>
<Line break>
5. The headline for Travis' team is obvious. Connor McDavid is good at 
hockey.  He posted 50.5 points for Trav this week and was paramount 
in his win against Ryan. 
<Line break>
6. A breazy little pick up with Tyler Motte early in week 4. Motte has
had alot of success in Vancouver this season. His triple position 
eligibility makes him a swiss army knife for Fleming. But, is the production
sustainable? It's hard to say. He is averaging 5.4 points a night but that 
is being bolstered by his 10.5 point night on 1/27, and his 9 point night 
on 1/25, both against Ottawa. He is on the 4th line and isn't seeing PP 
time at the moment. Travis is wise to scoop him up while he's hot, but I 
don't foresee him being a mainstay. 
<Line break>
7. Matt Barzal being on this team is the perfect second fiddle to McDavid. 
Barzal has the potential to take over any games he is in and can provide 
a good amount of points in the weeks that (if any) McDavid decides to 
take it easy. 
<Line break>
8. Hellebuyck has been letting alot of goals in lately, but still scooping
up wins. When he starts zeroing in on his game, Travis will be a hard out 
every week. I expect that to start soon. 
<Line break>
<Line break>
<b> Darin </b>
<Line break>
<Line break>
9. What a start Darin has had compared to last year. He may be the 
first annual recipient of the "Strzelecki Award for Most Improved Team."
<Line break>
10. Johnny Gaudreau has entered the battlefield. Johnny Ham and Cheese has
registered 23.5 points for Dare-bear in week 3 and it was much needed. 
In fact, the more that I look at his numbers, the more that I see that he 
has been much more consistent this year. 
<Line break>
11. Safe to say that T-Barrie is loving his stay in Edmonton. He put up
some pretty heady numbers this week (22.5) and seems to be ramping up. 
He had a bit of a slow start but he's turned it on in the last 7 days or so.
<Line break>
12. Man, EK has been disappointing in San Jose, hasn't he? Remember when 
we thought that the entire NHL was on notice when thinking about a 
Burns and Karlsson tandem? EK has 3 assists on the year so far which
seems like a far cry from his glory days. Hopefully he finds his game. 
<Line break>
<Line break>
<b> Nick </b>
<Line break>
<Line break>
13. I, and I'm sure the rest of you, consider ourselves lucky that neither
Travis or Nick have both McDavid and Draisaitl. Had that had happened, 
it would be hard to beat. Drai enjoyed 40.5 points in fantasy this week
and apparently is baking a pie with his 6 apples Sunday night. If someone
possessed both of them, they would have a combined 91 points in week 3
alone. 
<Line break>
14. Nick has to be hoping that Malkin is going to wake up soon, right? 
Geno has an assist or a goal here or there but is only averaging 2.7 points
a night. He needs to be better. 
<Line break>
15. I heard through the grapevine that Point was in (albeit briefly) 
trade talks this week. Now, i don't know if he's untouchable in Nick's
eyes but... it'll take alot to pry him from this team if he's not. 
<Line break>
16. Bobrovsky isn't playing much in Florida right now... which is crazy
when you consider his cap hit. But, he has 3 wins in his last 3 starts. 
Something to keep an eye on. 
<Line break>
<Line break>
<b> Chris </b>
<Line break>
<Line break>
17. Carter Hart hasn't had a great start to his season. But, he has 2 wins
in 2 starts... so, maybe he is turning the corner. Chris certainly hopes
so, especially with Fleury and the VGK being sidelined for COVID.
<Line break>
18. JT Miller had a 16 point night on 1/27. He was one of Chris' keepers 
going into this season. It is crazy to think about his evolution in the Van.
Chris' decision to retain him over the summer is certainly paying off. 
<Line break>
19. With Pastrnak coming back to the team in Boston, I'd say that the
stage is set for Marchand to hit his usual gear. He has been fine thus
far, but I suspect that he will be a points leader on Chris' team
within the next week or so. 
<Line break>
20. Staying in Boston, it appears that I have reverse mushed McAvoy. 
Last week, I wrote about how he has been abysmal in the fantasy world. 
But then he turns around and posts 21.5 points for Chris. He has had at
least 1 point in his last 4 games and with the aforementioned Pasta
returning, there doesn't seem to be any reason why that should stop. 
Let's just hope that I didn't jinx it. 
<Line break>
21. Travis Konecny getting scratched on Saturday didn't help much. TK 
posted 4 points in week 3 and is likely a good reason why Chris (barely)
lost against Darin. 
<Line break>
<Line break>
<b> Ryan </b>
<Line break>
<Line break>
22. Y'know, its sort of fitting that the team that has Laine is the team 
with the most goals in the season so far. Ryan has 54 goals thus far and
70 Assists (ranked #6 in VHL). If his roster can put up a few more assits
and retain the scoring touch, we'll see Ryan climb up in the standings. 
<Line break>
23. There was alot of heated public discussion regarding trades this week, 
with Strez, Nick, and Chris leading the charge. What many may have noticed
was that Ryan was pretty mum about any involvement he may or may not
have had related to those talks. I won't go into specifics, but Ryan 
was out there lurking. 
<Line break>
24. I apparently reverse-mushed Pettersson too. I remarked that he needed
to be better last week and he ended up throwing me the bird in his 24.0
point production in week 3.
<Line break>
25. I think Ryan lost week 3 largely due to Winnipeg not playing as much 
as other teams. Scheifele and Connor both up around 4 points. Another 
element to this is Laine has been quarantined before debuting for CBJ. 
That period is over. Ryan will bounce back this week now that Winnipeg
has a bit more of a fuller schedule and Laine is activated in Ohio. 
<Line break>
<Line break>
<b> Mike </b>
<Line break>
<Line break>
26. Mike barely won this week against Strez. It was looking grim late into 
the matchup but a timely goal from Yamamota and Stutzle barely put
him over the top. It shouldn't have been that close though. Ovechkin 
came off of IR saturday night and posted 13 points, however, Mike couldn't
play him due to roster locks. He also, foolishly, thought Wilson was benched. 
Wilson went on to score 8 points. A win is a win but... it would have been 
heartbreaking had he had lost under those circumstances. 
<Line break>
27. Mike and Craig engaged with a trade after a very long Sunday afternoon
regarding discussions. Now, word on the street is that the trade that went
through was offered Saturday night before the fireworks went off.
The call was held up due to other discussion's from Craig's camp. 
<Line break>
28. I don't know why GM's in our leagues do this... but the minute 
trade offers go public, they seem to fizzle out. The only trade on Sunday 
that went through was the one that no one really knew about... or at 
least the one that no one was talking about. Craig and Mike discussed 
on the side and got a deal done. 
<Line break>
29. Mike was offered a deal Saturday night that he wasn't specifically
thrilled with and counter offered. Craig took the time to munch it over
and decided to shelf it and look for other opportunities. As was his right. 
<Line break>
30. The Trade makes sense for Mike. He was pretty redunant with having 
Makar, Girard, and Byram from Colorad's blueline on his roster. 
He also didn't need Carlson if he had both Ovi and Wilson. So, 
He gave up elite fantasy dman Carlson and mid-level fantasy dman Girard
for Bergeron and Kakko. Bergeron retains most of the production Mike loses
with Carlson being shipped out and he takes a chance on Kakko potentially
blossoming this year.
<Line break>
<Line break>
<b> Craig </b>
<Line break>
<Line break>
30. Now, this isn't a slam piece on Craig. Far from it. I'm actually
highlighting the fact that he got a reasonable deal done with another GM. 
It shakes up the two rosters and provides a nice boost for Craig. 
With Pasta returning, he doesn't need Bergeron and picks up Carlson
from the Caps. Carlson was THE premier Dman in fantasy last year and shows
no signs of stopping. Craig also gets rid of Kakko who was anchoring his
roster for a defensman in Girard who is on the second pair of an electric
Colorado team as well as the second PP unit. If nothing else, he is an
upgrade from Kakko in the points category. 
<Line break>
It is also worth noting that Carlson is 31 years of age and has 6 years 
left on his contract. He's not going anywhere. He is and should be 
a longtime keeper for Craig. Bergeron, as good as he is, has 2 years left
on his current deal and  is 35. His production may not fall off this year
but it's coming. Craig will likely keep Carlson. Mike will likely
not keep Bergeron. There's value there. 
<Line break>
31. Craig did, indeed, offer up some lopsided trades (in various degrees)
to other GM's this weekend. There's no doubt about that. But, based off the 
fair and pretty balanced trade with Mike... I think the full on roasting
that Craig underwent from other GM's was a little overboard. Guys have 
a right to be upset or even insulted when a laughable offer hits their 
table, but it is certainly feasible that Fischer isn't always
trying to pull the wool over their eyes. Does he have a history of it? 
Sure. But that does not mean he should be blacklisted from future deals?
I would say, no. This league is trade-starved as it is. And the Craig/Mike
deal is proof enough that Craig is able to be reasoned with.  
<Line break>
32. The main point is this: if you're unhappy about a deal, whether it
be at the hands of Craig, Peter Chiarelli, or Steve Yzerman himself, handle 
it privately. There's no reason to put a guy on blast for 4 hours straight
when all he is trying to do is better his team. This league has been
around for 7 seasons already and when you're, doesn't matter who, insulting
a guy for the better part of an afternoon and allowing others to gang up on
him... it can crack someone. I know that I would be butthurt if that had
happened to me. 
<Line break>
33. Conversely, I can't think of a good reason to openly talk about a 
deal on the public chat. When Craig started asking Nick in the public forum
about his offer... I knew the storm was coming. Making your business
known to the rest of the league is a breeding ground for having your trades
be meddled with, criticized (as what happened to Craig), and bad blood being 
boiled.
<Line break> 
One or two seasons ago Strez and Craig were briefly discussing a Pasta 
trade and it spilled over to the rest of the league. Before anyone knew 
it, other GM's inquired and muddied those waters and the deal died on arrival.
This happens every year, it feels like. 
<Line break>
For the good of the league... whether you're the one offering or the one
getting an offer, I suggest keeping it private. Sling your mud in there to
your heart's content but there's no reason to make it a public execution. 
This is, after all, for mostly fun and I certainly don't want to have to
look for a replacement GM in the event people take it too far.
