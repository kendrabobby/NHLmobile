"We face uncertain  times as the calendar flipped to 2021. We have a shortened season, 
locked Divisions featuring nothing but rivalry games from January through May, and the 
always looming threat of a crash of COVID dismantling an NHL team (and in turn, VHL teams)
in the blink of an eye. This year's draft came quick. The date seemed to be upon us faster 
than years past and it gave most of the GM's of the league little time to prepare. It's up 
for debate who was the clear cut winners and losers however this recap can spark the 
discussions. We start with the Keepers and then move directly into the highlights of each

  round with three goalies being snagged. ", tags$b("Binnington, Khudobin, and Rask "), "were all picked

  be honest… doesn't it seem like he has been in the league for 15 years? He's 27. ", tags$i("Strez "), "snagged him. ",

  he is slated to be the second line center for the Sharks and the team themselves reported this week that they 
  see themselves as a playoff team. The potential star in ", tags$b("Fox "), "is just that… a potential (read: may never

  Lee "), "pick. ", tags$b("Lee "), "had a hair over 300 Fpts in our league last year and was on track to eclipse/pass his 
  best season totals with 14 games to go before stoppage of play.",

  Bay Cup win this summer and has the tools to help them run it back. Another potential smudge on ", tags$i("Chris' "),
  "draft comes with his ", tags$b("Quinton Byfield "), "pick. Now, don't get me wrong, the 2020 NHL Draft #2 overall will 
  be a force in the NHL eventually… but recent reports cite that LA does not expect him to have any substantial 
  playtime this year as he is still a bit of a raw player. Had ", tags$i("Chris "), "picked him up in this round in next
  year's VHL draft, I'd be singing his praises… but unless ", tags$b("Byfield "), "really turns some heads during LA's camp,

  in the NHL seems to be concerned about ", tags$b("Hughes' "), "development thus far and the young center has likely
  found his groove now after a year in Newark. This can be another keeper pick selected in this very late round.
  The winner, though, of this round is ", tags$i("Ryan "), "with his ", tags$b("Kirill Kaprizov "), "pick. Considered to be
  the most finished among the three young players being mentioned in this section, ", tags$b("Kaprizov "), "has the potential
  to come over from the KHL and start producing at a clip in the NHL. He's a bit older than most rookies and was
