We face uncertain  times as the calendar flipped to 2021. We have a shortened season, locked Divisions featuring nothing but rivalry games from January through May, and the always looming threat of a crash of COVID dismantling an NHL team (and in turn, VHL teams) in the blink of an eye. This year's draft came quick. The date seemed to be upon us faster than years past and it gave most of the GM's of the league little time to prepare. It's up for debate who was the clear cut winners and losers however this recap can spark the discussions. We start with the Keepers and then move directly into the highlights of each round. 
\n
\n<b>Keepers</b>
\n
\n<i>Strez</i> 
\nKucherov (ouch, Out for season), Matthews, Svechnikov, M. Tkachuk, and Nathan Makinnon
\n
\n<i>Darin</i>
\nB. Tkachuk, Hall, Marner, E. Karlsson, Tarasenko
\n
\n<i>Ryan</i> 
\nAho (Carolina), Laine, Rantanen, Pettersson, Scheifele
\n
\n<i>Nick</i>
\nVasilevsky, Malkin, Draisaitl, Hamilton, Stamkos

<i>Travis</i>
McDavid, Jarry, Panarin, Josi, Guentzel

<i>Chris</i> 
J.T. Miller, Eichel, Kane, Hart, Marchand

<i>Mike</i> 
Shesterkin, Zibanejad, Makar, Ovechkin, Carlson

<i>Craig</i> 
Kakko, Letang, Pastrnak, Crosby, {Huberdeau}
Craig, being the only GM to opt to not retain all 5 of his keepers this year entered into a pre-draft to “select” a fifth Keeper from the remaining pool of players. He selected Huberdeau. 

The nature of Keepers makes it hard to decide who has the better crop given that most of the keepers are all top tier players whom would all go in the first few rounds if they were available. If I had to give a slight edge to one of the GM's, it may have originally gone to Strez but given that Kucherov is out for the season, I give the nod to Nick. A clear cut top goalie with Vasi coupled with Hart winner Draisaitl, dependable Malkin and Hamilton, and the captain of the Stanley Cup Winning Tampa Bay Lighting, Stamkos. It remains to be seen if Malkin, Hamilton, and Stamkos can stay healthy for the shortened season but you can bet that if they do, Nick has a good core here. 
I am aware that the first 5 rounds are the “Keeper” rounds but, I don't really count them in my mind. So, from henceforth, the actual round 6 will be listed as Round 1, 7 as 2, so and so forth. Lets break down the highlights of each round and talk about what happened

<b>Round 1</i>
In what I thought was a weird strategy, <i>Travis</i> picked up a goalie as his first pick of the draft, <b>Connor Hellebuyck.</b> He wanted to make sure to snag the Vezina winning goalie quick despite the fact that everyone went for proven commodities  like <b>Brent Burns, John Tavares, Patrice Bergeron, or Vector Hedman</b> <i>(Ryan, Darin, Craig, Nick).</i> <b>Brent Burns</b> going to <i>Ryan</i> marks the first time since the Keeper system was incepted in the VHL that <b>Burns</b> has departed <i>Mike's</i> team, a true sign of the times. The winner of this round can be seen as a tie between <i>Craig and Chris</i> who picked up <b>Bergeron and Wheeler</b> respectively. <b>Bergeron</b> will likely be named the Captain of the B's this year and has always been a model of consistency and <b>Wheeler</b> has been the unsung hero in Winnipeg behind <b>Laine and Scheifele</b> in offensive production. 
<b>Round 2</b> 
<b>Hellebuyck</b> getting traded so early on triggered a reaction among the GM's in this round with three goalies being snagged. <b>Binnington, Khudobin, and Rask</b> were all picked up by <i>Strez, Ryan, and Craig</i> respectively. An interesting little note about the <b>Khudobin</b> was that during <i>Ryan's</i> pick, <i>Craig</i> attempted to call him regarding the video conference of all of the GM's during the draft. What <i>Craig</i> likely didn't know was that <i>Ryan</i> was working remotely and needed his phone to draft. He missed his chance and autopicked <b>Khudobin</b> when he was reported to be targeting <b>Frederik Andersen</b>. A shame. Aside from that, <b>Rust</b> was picked by <i>Travis</i> to the surprise of no one. Winner? <i>Mike</i> picking up <b>Pacioretty</b> who had a great year last year in Vegas and was also on <i>Mike's</i> squad but was opted to not be retained as a keeper. 
<b>Round 3</b>
One man's folly is another's opportunity and such was the case with <i>Darin</i> picking up <b>Anderson</b> the very round after <i>Ryan</i> tried. Tough break. While <i>Craig</i> didn't keep to his promise in drafted him in the first round, he did pick <b>Alexis Lafreniere</b> in this round, shoring up his 2 young Rangers keeper slots. Winner: It's a tie between <i>Mike and Ryan</i>, <i>Mike</i> drafted <b>Tom Wilson</b> who garners bags full of peripheral points in the VHL (hits, blocks, etc.) as well as bringing a scoring touch. <i>Ryan</i> grabbed <b>Kyle Connor</b> who almost bagged 40 goals in a slumping Winnipeg last year. 
<b>Round 4</b> 
I think <b>Jamie Benn</b> being drafted so high is a little risky for <i>Strez</i>, he put up 327 Fpts last year but his offensive production has been trending down every year as he gets older, couple that with being a physical, aging player who just played in the SCF, I think he is a candidate for an extreme regression this year. We'll see. I do like the <b>Dahlin</b> pick by <i>Nick</i> as the Swede is getting to a prime age for an offensive defenseman to start flexing. Downside? He's playing in Buffalo who has switched over to a very difficult Eastern Division. Still, I think that <i>Nick</i> will be happy at the end of the year. I think that's why I Put <i>Nick</i> as my winner here but that's only because <b>Barzal</b> still isn't signed. If he were, I'd give the edge to <i>Travis</i> in this one.
<b>Round 5</b> 
My only real thought about this round is that if <b>Gaudreau</b> bounces back in a big way this year, <i>Darin</i> will be the winner of this round. 
<b>Round 6</b> 
<b>Jean-Gabriel Pageau</b> was a force in the playoffs this summer and I think will be a staple for the Islanders for most of his new 6 year contract. <i>Nick</i> made a wise decision here. I scratch my head at <b>Fleury</b> being picked up by <i>Chris</i> when <b>Lehner</b> was still out there and is slated to be the starter in Vegas. <b>Quinn Hughes</b> getting snagged here by <i>Mike</i>will likely pay dividends and will be a keeper candidate at season's end. <b>Markstrom</b> getting grabbed by <i>Darin</i> under the nose of everyone was a sneaky move, I think. I don't know who the winner is here, I think it's <i>Mike</i> given <b>Quinn Hughes'</b> tremendous potential but I do know who the loser is here: <i>Chris</i> with that very uninformed pick with <b>Fleury</b>, though, it can shift dramatically if the Flower gets traded somewhere else – a reasonable outcome. 
<b>Round 7</b> 
<i>Ryan</i> took a calculated risk in drafting <b>Hoffman</b> here when he was still a UFA. The player has since signed a PTO with the Blue's which will likely be graduated to a bonafide contract and will complete the vision for <i>Ryan</i>. I make fun of <b>Pionk</b> all of the time but I can't deny that I think he has good value being picked up here by <i>Travis</i>. <b>Pionk</b> had 320 Fpts last season as a defenseman, he isn't the slouch that he was in New York. <b>Evander Kane</b> returns for another go with <i>Craig's</i> squad and makes <i>Craig</i> the winner this round. 360 Fpts on an inept San Jose team last year means that he is  likely to return to form this year. He's had plenty of time to rest. 
<b>Round 8</b> 
Not much to comment on in this round <i>Ryan <i>drafted <b>Couturier</b> and <i>Travis</i> drafted <b>Kreider</b> both of which are very good mid range guys, as is <i>Darin's</i> <b>Bo Horvat</b> but I think the GM that might have struck gold is <i>Craig</i> in drafted <b>Pierre-Luc Dubois</b> who has recently requested a trade out of Columbus, cited to be looking for a “bigger” stage. If PLD gets traded to a team who wants to welcome him with a top 6 role, I think <i>Craig</i> walks away with a win here. 
<b>Round 9</b> 
<i>Darin</i> has been opportunistic with his goalie selections this year and has grabbed <b>Robin Lehner <b>two round after his back up <b>Fleury</b> was drafted. The highlight here is the sleeper D picks during this round. <b>Graves, Shea Weber, and Dumba</b> being drafted by <i>Craig, Ryan, and Strez</i> makes this round end with a three way tie. All three of these dmen come from various points in their career.  <b>Graves</b> a young player who showed real talent after given time last year in Colorado, <b>Weber</b> the aging Captain of the Habs who, for some reason, everyone overlooks, and <b>Dumba</b> the keystone Dman in Minnesota who is bound to bounce back this year after a rough year last year. I have all three having big years this year.
<b>Round 10</b> 
<b>Timo Meier</b> is always a good depth pick in fantasy, very reliable player, good on <i>Nick</i> for investing in him. Doesn't it feel like <b>Oshie</b> just gets drafted based on name recognition these days? He hasn't been that great of a player the last couple of years. Still, <i>Chris</i> could have done worse. <i>Darin drafted <b>Tyson Barrie</b> in this round and while his one year in Toronto wasn't terrible, he definitely had a regression. I wonder howe he fares in Edmonton. This round was so bland, I don't think I have a winner. 
<b>Round 11</b> 
How did we have that last round be so boring and this following round be so good? How in the world was <b>Tyler Seguin</b> still available? If you only care about the winners of each round, read no further because <i>Travis</i> is it. I don't know why everyone was waiting to draft him… but you don't get extra points for drafting good players as late in the draft as you can. <b>Nick Suzuki</b> was a bright spot for the Habs in the return to play last summer and <i>Strez</i> wasted no time nabbing him up. Homer Alert: <b>Kapanen</b> was drafted by <i>Craig</i> for reasons that only a Yinzer would understand.  <i>Mike</i> has to be upset with himself drafting <b>William Karlsson</b> when the superior centerman <b>Brayden Schenn</b> was still out there, waiting to be drafted by <i>Ryan</i>. 
<b>Round 12</b>
For whatever reason there are a lot of folks in the NHL and in the VHL that are sleeping on <b>Adam Fox,</b> the guy who had Calder votes last year and who lit the NCAA world on fire when he played for Harvard. It isn't a secret, given his NYR fandom that <i>Mike</i> picked him up with the hopes that he can be a potential keeper pick in future seasons. Another player picked up in this round was <b>Tomas Hertl</b> and I have to be honest… doesn't it seem like he has been in the league for 15 years? He's 27. <i>Strez</i> snagged him. <b>Hertl</b> is an interesting pick, though, due to his lackluster performance last year due to injury but he is slated to be the second line center for the Sharks and the team themselves reported this week that they see themselves as a playoff team. The potential star in <b>Fox</b> is just that… a potential (read: may never happen) and because of that, I have to deem <i>Craig</i> as the winner of this round with his <b>Anders Lee</b> pick. <b>Lee</b> had a hair over 300 Fpts in our league last year and was on track to eclipse/pass his best season totals with 14 games to go before stoppage of play. 
<b>Round 13</b> 
<i>Craig</i> had another wise pick in <b>Cirelli</b> who will look to build upon his young career in Tampa. While I don't expect him to break the league this year, <b>Cirelli</b> was a paramount player in the Tampa Bay Cup win this summer and has the tools to help them run it back. Another potential smudge on <i>Chris'</i> draft comes with his <b>Quinton Byfield</b> pick. Now, don't get me wrong, the 2020 NHL Draft #2 overall will be a force in the NHL eventually… but recent reports cite that LA does not expect him to have any substantial playtime this year as he is still a bit of a raw player. Had <i>Chris</i> picked him up in this round in next year's VHL draft, I'd be singing his praises… but unless <b>Byfield</b> really turns some heads during LA's camp, this is going to be a bust of a pick. The winner of this round, though, is <i>Ryan</i> and his love for every player on Winnipeg. <i>Ryan</i> snatched up <b>Nickolaj Ehlers</b> who has been a good role player for the Peg. Not a dazzling player by any stretch but in these later rounds they hardly ever are. 
<b>Round 14</b>
There's a few GM's here in this round who are swinging for the fences with their Dman picks and I applaud them for it. <i>Nick</i> drafted <b>Tony DeAngelo</b> and <i>Darin</i> picked up <b>John Marino.<b><b>Tony D</b> was among one of the league's best offensive defenseman last year and looks to have gelled tremendously with the offensively potent New York Rangers. This pick can net <i>Nick</i> some much needed Dman oomph and will pay dividends. <b>Tony D</b> is also very likely on the trading block in NY and can go to even more potent team down the line. <b>Marino,</b> like <b>Fox</b> stood out last year as a very sturdy, gifted young Dman in a year that hard plenty of them in the NHL. Couple that fact and his extension with the Penguins and we may look back at this round as a steal for <i>Darin.</i> I think that <i>Chris</i> had a very level headed pick in taking a flyer on Detroit Captain <b>Dylan Larkin</b> who, despite playing on the worst NHL team statistically in decades still managed to crack 300 Fpts in our league last year. My winner: <i>Nick</I> for now but if I had the option to retroactively deem a winner, I think <i>Darin</i> would get it if <b>Marino</b> continues to impress. 
<b>Round 15</b> 
<b>John Gibson</b> going to <i>Ryan</i> was a heady move for the GM. <b>Gibson</b> has been a workhouse for Anaheim and will get the lion's share of starts over there. Of course, Anaheim isn't a particularly good club, so, he may not garner some wins… but if they get hot during this short season, it'll pay off. I think <b>Anthony Duclair</b> has a lot to prove to the league after he went for what seemed like ages before he finally got signed by the Panthers. That can be a boon for <i>Nick</i> if he does indeed come out like a bat out of hell. The fact that Hart Candidate <b>Panarin's</b> centreman went this late in the game (<b>Ryan Strome)</b> surprises me, good on <i>Chris</i> for giving him a chance. <i>Darin's</i> pick up of <b>Vrana</b> is the epitome of a good depth pick for a fantasy draft. Why are we still drafting <b>Aaron Ekblad?<b>My winner for this round is <i>Mike</i> with his pick up of <b>Ondrej Palat</b> who is, at the moment, slated to start on the top line along side <b>Point and Stamkos.</b> With that sort of firepower you have to expect him to put up points. Tampa Bay John Cooper has a tendency to mix up his lines a lot, though, so I may be speaking too soon. 
<b>Round 16</b>
This is the round of value-goalies. Both <i>Mike and Craig</i> found really good value in this very late round to shore up their net presence. <i>Craig</i> gave <b>Elvis Merzlikins</b> who had himself a pretty good year last season in Columbus and will again be looking to win over the starter's crease. <i>Mike</i> gave <b>Juuse Saros</b> a flyer in this late round and is shaping up to be the heir to <b>Rinne's</b> net now that the 38 year old is in the twilight of his career. Two goalies for two pretty good teams, I'm sure both GM's liked what they did there. Goalies aside it's hard to give a nod to who won this round as all of the players left are all within the same wheelhouse offensively. All but one, anyway. <i>Darin's</i> pick of <b>Radulov</b> is a true late round pick in that he had a down year last year, just had a recent controversy in Russia regarding millions of his take home pay not being insured by a now-defunct bank, recently went the distance but fell short by losing in the SCF… but he still has the talent and ability to turn his game around. The odds are staked against <b>Radulov</b> this year… but <i>Darin</i> gave him a chance anyway. My nod for round winner goes to <i>Strez</i> with the <b>Tomas Tatar</b> pick. <b>Tatar</b> bagged a c-hair above 300 Fpts in our league last year and is penciled in for the top line on a resurging Montreal Team. 
<b>Round 17</b>
There's two stories in this round that I'd like to touch on. One: <i>Darin</i> has to be a little peaved that he took <b>Nicklas Backstrom</b> over <i>Chris'</i> <b>Anze Kopitar.</b> <b>Backstrom</b> only bagged 243 Fpts last season even riding shotgun along <b>Ovechkin</b> for a good chunk of it while <b>Kopitar</b> enjoyed 308 Fpts on a very lackluster LA team. Both players are getting up there in age so there is no clear advantage there but if I'm <i>Darin,</i> who drafted before <i>Chris</i> in this round… I'm a little butthurt. The other storyline is the three young players picked up by some lucky GM's. <i>Mike</i> laid claim to the WJC MVP</b>Tim Stutzle</b> who will find a place on a very young Ottawa roster and is a calder candidate going into this 2021 season. The Question mark surround this player is whether or not he will light up the league as <i>Mike</i> hopes. The answer is likely no, but, he can end up being a keeper candidate and a core player for <i>Mike's</i> team for years to come. <i>Strez</i> took last year's 1OA pick (meanwhile… <b>Kakko</b> was a keeper. Hmm.) <b>Jack hughes</b> who will be looking to bounce back after a rough rookie season. No one in the NHL seems to be concerned about <b>Hughes'</b> development thus far and the young center has likely found his groove now after a year in Newark. This can be another keeper pick selected in this very late round. The winner, though, of this round is <i>Ryan</i> with his <b>Kirill Kaprizov<b>pick. Considered to be the most finished among the three young players being mentioned in this section, <b>Kaprizov</b> has the potential to come over from the KHL and start producing at a clip in the NHL. He's a bit older than most rookies and was drafted very late in the NHL draft back in 2015 but he seems ready to come in and light it up. We could have another <b>Panarin</b> entry on our hands. 
<b>Round 18</b>
Not much to be expected from the last round of the draft. <i>Craig</i> is hoping <b>Jakub Voracek</b> can turn back time a little bit this year, as is <i>Darin</i> with his <b>Phil Kessel</b> pick. Nice little d picks with <i>Mike and Strez's</i> <Samuel Girard and Esa Lindell</b> pick ups. I think the winner of this round, though, is <i>Travis</i> is <b>Brock Boeser</b> can find the magic he found a couple of seasons ago on a formidable Vancouver team. 

This was a long one, to be sure, but I think everyone drafted fairly well. Some of the GM's had some homeruns, others had some bunts, a few more had some complete misses but one thing that I've always values is the parity of our league. Even the league juggernauts seem to fall to the little guys every so often. I won't comment on who won the draft, I'll leave that to you guys, but hopefully I made it a bit easier for you to project. The 2021 season is a few short days from starting… lets make it a good one.
