    for: the return of the Vargas Hockey League articles. I'm sure half
    of you will read this, a quarter of you won't read it but tell me
    'hey man, great read!' and the last quarter of you will never see
    this because you still think the articles are written on a website

    around the league regarding regular updates and I found it fitting
    that we should get back to some roots becauase we are on the doorstep
    of the 10th anniversary of our league. Ideas for how to commemorate
    this are still up in the air but I will be working diligently to bring
    something memorable to the table. ",

    second year in a row that we got all of our GM's on a zoom call 
    together, which is always great to see. Darin's wedding definitely
    had a hand in garnering interest again in the league. It served as a
    great primer due to 3/4 of our league being present for it. ",

    the newly minted teams going into the 9th season of the VHL. I have 
    to admit that every year that we do this, the quality of drafting 
    seems to increase with it. I don't think there are any clear cut 
    'losers' or 'winners' anymore. You can certainly argue that some teams
    are, on paper, better than others - perhaps. But, if recent years 
    have shown, sometimes the projected good teams end up being paper 
    tigers while the projected bad teams come out from the deep, dark, 
    parts of the world and end up being a Balrog of a team that seems 
    unbeatable.",
    br(), br(),
    "There were, of course, a few bits of intrigue going into this year's
    draft. Who would Vargas, the owner of the 1OA pick draft after all of
    the keepers have been declared? Who would Ryan or Strez keep on their 
    teams from last year - both of which were wrought with elite/generational
    talents that would be hard to watch return to the pool of availability?
    Would there be any last minute deals that can change the landscape of
    the draft itself? ",

      Mo Seider",

      days of the off season.", 
    br(), 
    "Regardless of how these questions were indeed
    answers, it still led to a completed draft that has our 8 teams primed
    and ready to take off running. Lets see how they did. ",
    br(), br(),
    "The first overall pick was, as mentioned, Sebastion Aho. This pick
    was intriguing to me as I felt that there were a few worthwhile
    alternatives available, even after all 40 keepers were claimed, 
    especially given the route Chris Vargas seemed to be headed with his
    team. Chris' strategy seemed to be to find high end young players
    who could both develop and potentially pop off into stardom. his 
    offseason trade with Ryan signaled this early when he traded away Jack 
    Eichel for Jack Hughes. Hughes is, by all accounts, projected to 
    ascent into the elite tier of players as soon as this year - so the 
    move seemed pretty safe given what Vargas was shooting for. ",
    br(), br(),
      "Which makes the Aho pick, though not a bad one, a bit perplexing. 
    Both Moritz Seider (projected to be among the top 5 defensemen in the
    VHL) and Nick Suzuki (projected to be part of the 400 club - one that 
    only ~20 centers were part of last year) were both on the table. 
    One can assume that despite the glut of boom or bust prospects on
    the Vargas team, he likely wanted a consistent and sure fire player
    that is established enough to carry production  when some of the mystery
    boxes on his team struggle. You can look at the rest of this team and 
    deduce that that may have been the intention.",
    br(), br(),
      "Sprinkled into this team of youngsters, are exactly what is described 
    above: established, consistent players: Bergeron, P. Kane, Marchand, 
    Gaudreau. These guys, if healthy, will continue to drive the scoring
    when the likes of Stutzle, Zegras, Hughes, Beniers, Caufield, 
    Raymond, inevitably struggle at times. It is worth mentioning that 
    ESPN has none of the players on this team projected to hit 400 points.
    This can be a bit of a detriment due to other teams in the league 
    featuring players that have 500+ projected point players. However, 
    if some of these lottery ticket young players can hit that next level:
    this team can certainly change the narrative of Vargas team being a
    perennial bottom feeder. ",
    br(), br(),
      "Ryan Lennon's team was another one that was of interest to me, and the 
    league at large. Many of the guys that brought him to a third title
    last year are gone: Seider, Aho, Dobson, Pettersson, Hughes just to
    name a few. His team still has his crown jewel: Cale Makar, an unlikely
    addition to his team last year when he was brought in from a trade 
    with Mike. A trade that featured a conditional 1st round pick, 
    Tarasenko, Burakovsky, and Werenski going the other way. None of
    those players are on Mike's team going into this year, but the 1st
    rounder definitely granted Mike the opportunity to snag the coughed up
    Mo Seider, without risk of losing draft capital to also pick up Suzuki.",
    br(), br(),
    "Mike can now look back and say that he effectively traded Makar for 
    Seider. Makar is, no doubt, the clear cut best defensemen in the VHL, 
    projected to reach 466.5 points - head and shoulders above the next 
    in line: none other than Mo Seider at 406.5. But after Makar, Ryan's
    dmen fall a bit off of a cliff. The next best on this team is Jeff
    Petry at 356. There a few mystery boxes currently on this team 
    in Jake Sanderson and Nick Blankenburg. These young guys could
    provide some boom potential if they pan out early in their careers
    and given Ryan's nose for sniffing out relatively unknown guys and 
    having them blossom, this could be his remedy to losing the much coveted
    Seider. ",
    br(), br(),
    "But, I believe that the comparisons in Dmen between Mike and Ryan's 
    teams will be there for much of the season. Would you rather have 
    THE guy in Makar (466.5) and then surround him with a supporting cast?
    Or do you want an ensemble like Mike: Seider (406.5), Fox (380.5) and
    Dobson (366.5)? This year could be a good yard stick to measure which
    two idealogies work better. ",
    br(), br(),
    "A larger version of what I just described can be seen in comparing 
    Travis and Strez's groups. Travis proudly owns McDavid on his team - 
    the unquestioned best player in both the NHL and the VHL. However, 
    when looking at Travis' group, much like Ryan's D group, there is a 
    steep drop off until the next tier of players around McDavid. 
    McJesus is projected to get almost 550 points in the VHL this year
    and the next guy in line on this team is Guentzel sitting at 431. 
    In fact, Guentzel is the only guy on the team projected to hit 400+
    while the rest of his team, McDavid aside, will be sub 400.",
    br(), br(),
    "When you compare this to Strez, who, admittedly, has Matthews projected
    for 528.5. He also features 5 other players projected to reach 400+
    (Mackinnon, Svechnikov, M. Tkachuk, E. Kane, and Kucherov. No doubt
    Travis has the best player in the league, but is it enough to buoy 
    the rest of his club? Will all ships rise with the tide? Will Mcdavid
    instead be anchored down by his teammates? How many nautical puns can 
    I fit in here? Probably a ship load. ",
    br(), br(),
    "I think Strez's team will be the better one, again, on paper. But, 
    Travis has demonstrated time and time again that he knows what hes 
    doing. He either wins championships, or spoils them for the favorite
    to win it - *cough* Craig *cough*. ",
    br(), br(),
    "Strez has won one championship, albeit in an abbreviated COVID riddled
    year, but it still counts. But one's gotta wonder if he wants another 
    just to shut the doubters up. He looks poised to do it, so long as the
    injury bug turns a blind eye to him. ",
    br(), br(),
    "The ultimate test for the 'win by committee' crowd will be found in 
    Craig's team. He has one of the teams not featuring a 500+ point 
    beast, but he has oodles of 400 and high 300 point players. I really
    liked Craig's draft because he has consistent players across the board.
    If you look at every position, there are not many question marks or 
    regression candidates. Center: Crosby, Barkov, Pavelski, JT Miller. 
    Wingers: Pastrnak, Huberdeau, Reinhart. Dmen: Ekblad, Hamilton, Morissey
    Goalies: Hellebuyck. ",
    br(), br(),
    "This team also features players poised to take the next step and provide
    even more production than previously thought: Norris, Pettersson, 
    Boser, Bunting, Thompson. We know what the floor for this team is, but,
    the ceiling is yet to be determined. The only question mark on this 
    team is if Bobrovsky can still keep the starter net in Florida. Even 
    still, I think Craig did a really good job limiting risk with this 
    team. ",
    br(), br(),
    "I think the award for the team with the lowest number of low end 
    players goes to Nick. He only has a few players on his roster that 
    are projected to go under 300 points. If we were to look at his 
    roster with a bellcurve showing projected point totals across
    all of his players, the tail would be long. Nick didn't have many 
    surprises regarding this year's draft. I can sense that he is definitely
    betting on Meier to replicate his season from last year where he totaled
    525.5 points in our league but is only projected to get 440.5 this year. ",
    br(), br(),
    "In fact, if you look across this team, there are a handful of players 
    that ESPN has projected to regress in a major way: Stamkos: 526.5 -> 
    435.0, Fialia: 415.5 -> 355, Kadri: 416 -> 313. Nick is, assuredly,
    gambling, but I also think ESPN is greatly dicounting these players
    and Nick may have an even better season than what is on paper currently. ",
    br(), br(),
    "Lastly, Darin: Ryan has the best Dman in the league. Mike has potentially
    the best future Dman group in the league, however Darin definitely 
    has the most established Dmen group in Hedman, Norris and McAvoy. 
    Those three guys are conistently at the top of their class and likely
    has given Darin the benefit of not questioning if they will produce,
    but how much more than can produce. ",
    br(), br(),
    "I am a tad concerned about the Travis/Mcdavid like fall off in projection
    under B. Tkachuk (532 proj) but if Forsberg (469 - 2022), Marner 
    (452 - 2022), Hintz (421 - 2022) and Tarasenko (437 - 2022) can all 
    return to form, I think Darin is in for a very competitive year. ",

    waivers. Talbot will likely see a surge upward in production thanks
    to Ottawa looking like a much improved team. ",

    "So, there we have it, some of my thoughts in the draft. Like I said
    at the top, I don't think there any real losers this year as it seems 
    everyone has found a formula that they believe can lead them to a champ's
    chest. ",

    start to shape up. I think the cadence this season will be every 2 
    weeks for articles. I have done that in the past and have found that 
    there is much more to talk about when you let the season marinate
    between articles. I also have started to assemble Ryan's champ's
    chest for his win last year. Whenever that is put together and gifted
    to him, I will no doubt reveal it on here. ",
