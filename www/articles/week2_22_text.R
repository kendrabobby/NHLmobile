    "As week 2 wrapped up, I realized that the matchups, as a whole seem
    to be a bit more competitive than previous years. So, I went back 
    and checked the week 2 scores from last season and averaged the 
    point differential from each match up, then did the same for this 
    year's week 2 and found that the gap between winners and losers
    this year is pretty much half of what it was at this time last year.",
        br(),br(),
        "Last year's average was 58.56 while this year's average is 29.8. 
    In my draft review, I brought up that it seems like the compete level
    ratchets up with every passing year and this little dive into 
    the numbers seems to be a point of validation to that sentiment. 
    The largest point gap in week 2 of last year was in Mike and Strez's
    matchup where Mike won by 96.25 points. The most narrow gap last year 
    was in Darin and Chris' matchup where it was 39.5 points. On the flip
    side, this year's biggest gap was in Nick and Craig's matchup where
    Nick won by 48.25 points. Narrowest was in Mike and Darin's matchup
    where Mike barely survived by 3.5 points.",
        br(),br(),
        "This all by no means implies that things will be tougher than last 
    season, but it is an interesting trend that I am going to monitor
    for at least the next few weeks.",
        br(),br(),
        "So, aside from that, who were the winners these last two weeks and
    who were the losers? At first glance, you'd deduce that Nick and Mike
    are unquestionably winners, as they remain undefeated through two 
    matchups. On the converse, you can guess that Craig and Chris then are
    the losers as they are still chasing their first win. That accounts 
    for half the league, so what of the other half? Are the winners for 
    real? Are the losers unlucky? Let's dive in.", 
        br(),br(),
        "I think you can look at Craig's roster and start to gather some logic
    behind his team's slow start. JT Miller (and Vancouver as a whole) has
    been pretty bad so far into the young season. Miller currently has 2G 1A
    and Craig also employs Pettersson and Boeser. I definitely feel that
    until the Van corrects itself, Craig may find it hard to also get right. 
    Additionally, he needs Barkov to start finding the back of the net. 
    He only has a few assists to offer so far into the season. 
    Aaron Ekblad and Josh Norris going to IR isn't going to help his cause 
    either.", 
        br(),br(),
        "In fact, for goals, Craig currently sits at the lowest of the league. 
    This probably has caused a whiplash effect for Craig given that he was
    head and shoulders the highest goal scorer in our league last year. 
    He needs his core players to start finding the back of the net if he 
    hopes to replicate the magic he had last year. At least he has Pasta.", 
        br(),br(),
        "And what of Chris? What needs to happen for his team to snag a 
    victory? Chris is actually middle of the pack when it comes to goals
    and assists so far into the season. And there doesn't seem to be any
    glaring holes in production, save for maybe Fleury who has had a 
    terrible start to his season in Minny. Beniers has been playing
    his way into Calder contention, Zegras has been fine, Aho and 
    Johnny Hockey have been playing really well. I'd assume that Chris
    would like more production out of Hughes and Patrick Kane who only
    have a goal split between the two of them.", 
        br(),br(),
        "In fact, the more I stare at the roster, the more I realize that his
    forwards are doing quite nicely. I think it is actually his Dmen that
    need to ramp it up a bit. Giordano, Parayko, and Klingberg all have 
    less than 3 points each. Chris may be wise to look for a trade with 
    someone if this trend continues. He could target a team that is Dmen 
    heavy but lacks another element on the forward lines.", 
        br(),br(),
        "Darin may fit this bill. Darin currently has Hedman, Josi, Heiskenen,
    Slavin, and eventually McAvoy. This is a top D group. However, outside 
    of Brady Tkachuk, I feel that Darin lacks a true 1-2 punch at forward. 
    You can squint and say Marner. But after that he has a lot of guys 
    that have been elite in the past: Seguin, Malkin, Tarasenko, all who 
    may not see the same success as they have had in past campaigns.", 
        br(),br(),
        "I want to go ahead and say that Darin's roster seems to be constructed
    just fine for the early to mid season. He almost beat Mike in week 2
    and he beat Chris handily in week 1. But, if he is indeed looking 
    for a trade partner, Chris may be great one. He can send McAvoy or 
    better for potentially Marchand? Both players are on IR for a few more
    weeks at least and both players fill a need on the opposite teams. 
    Darin gets a known commodity in Marchand who will produce and Chris 
    gets a consistent high tier D producer in McAvoy. It is worth noting that
    Marchand produced 423 points in our league last year while McAvoy 
    produced 389. There is a clear discrepency, yes, but there are far
    less Dmen out there who can produce at a high level which may balance
    the scales. A caveat, though: McAvoy has no clear timetable to return
    while Marchand has been skating.", 
        br(),br(),
        "Another dance partner for Chris could be Mike. Between Fox, Seider, 
    Dobson, Cabot, and ... Pionk? There is a clear strength on that squad.
    There is also a clear Ranger bias on this roster. So, Mike sinks
    or swims based off of if the Rangers are doing well. Could Fox be on
    the table if the price is right for Chris? It's tough to say. It would 
    likely require one of the prestige young forwards to go Mike's way. 
    Stutzle, Zegras, or Beniers, ironically - all who have been on Mike's
    team at some point in previous seasons.", 
        br(),br(),
        "Or perhaps Chris really swings for the young player, high upside fences
    and targets Seider. Seider hasn't produced as he has last year quite yet, 
    only grabbing one assist thus far into the year, but the skill is 
    there and has been clamored over by at least two GM's in our league.
    It's all food for thought for Chris as he tries to change the narrative
    that his team is merely a speed bump on the way for other teams.", 
        br(),br(),
        "Despite Strez's week 1 loss, I think he is set up to be whatever the 
    opposite of Chris' team is. The weak spot on this team, though, looks
    to be goaltending. Swayman and Demko both have not produced much in 
    the first two weeks and I do wonder how long Strez will hang on to
    them. Swayman's counterpart - Ullmark, is ripe for the taking. So, 
    that solves one problem, maybe. But what of Demko? He is going to 
    be better than this, right? History would suggest so. The only value 
    guy out there is Knight, who Strez has already given up on. After that
    the pool is pretty shallow. The rest of his team, though? World class. 
    Aside from Benn who is likely washed and has never satisfied his wife.", 
        br(),br(),
        "Travis is seeing success, for sure. He leads the league in both goals
    and power play goals. He also has players that are having stellar 
    performances so far. Panarin is top of the league in points. Larkin 
    has turned it on to the tune of 3G 4A in the last two weeks. Dahlin
    seems to have finally arrived, I think he has some Dmen points streak 
    record going. Travis also has McDavid... which is nice.", 
        br(),br(),
        "He, is, however, being hit with an injury bug early. Guentzel is dealing
    with something, Bertuzzi is out, Quinn Hughes just got put onto IR, and 
    Toews is DTD. He is facing off against the undefeated Nick this week so
    some of those guys being hurt may be a bit of a detriment. We'll see
    how he manages.", 
        br(),br(),
        "I think there was a bit of a decision to make before the keepers were
    declared this offseason for Nick. To keep Stamkos for one more year
    or to cut bait and hope that he doesn't take the league by storm. Again. 
    It appears that Nick gambled correctly as Stamkos has been white hot 
    and is a huge reason for Nick's early success. Nick's decision to draft
    Robertson despite, at the time, not being signed with the Stars was 
    another gamble that is paying off. Kadri to Calgary could have been a
    bust but he is also coming to form nicely. Just call Nick the Gambler
    because he's throwing pocket aces all over the place. Even Shayne 
    Ghostisbehere, a guy who got sent to the desert from Philly is having
    a superb few weeks. I don't know how long this luck with hold, but it 
    bodes well for Nick.", 
        br(),br(),
        "Of course, he also has guys on this team who are known contributers, 
    we can't just sit here and assume that this is all lucky breaks. Nick
    does know what he's doing after all. Vasi is, yet again, that dude. 
    You can't go wrong with Draisaitl. Trouba, despite not hitting the 
    scoresheet all the time is a master of periphery stats (Hits, blocks,
    SOG). Nick will remain a top contender if his constants remain so and 
    his variables continue to solve for x.",
        br(),br(),
        "Much like Strez, Ryan is just humming along with his squad. Despite
    his yearly 'I don't think my team is going to be good' attitude, he is
    doing just fine. So fine, in fact, that he scored the most points in 
    week 2. His trade for Eichel is yielding expected results, Kaprizov is
    scoring in bunches, His Colorado trio (Makar, Rantanen, and Lehknonen) 
    are all keeping the stage set for when they can become a quartet with 
    their captain, Landeskog. Everything looks fine in Ryan land.", 
    br(),br(),
    "Or does it?",
    br(),br(),
    "Ryan has two premier goalies in Saros and Sorokin who are going to be
  good. However, they both only have a win a piece and it seems that their
  teams are failing them. They are also both on teams that don't allow a 
  ton of shots. Out of all the goalies who have played at least 4 games 
  this year, Saros ranks 11th out of 28 while Sorokin ranks 18th out of 
  28. This means that, yes, they are getting starts but if they aren't
  getting wins they aren't going to produce to their potential outputs. 
  There is also the matter that his third goalie is being added to the 
  ever growing pile of injuries. Forsberg has been serviceable for Ryan. 
  So much so that he is currently his best goalie. But with him being
  DTD, Ryan may be looking for a replacement.", 
      br(),br(),
      "Which brings us to the bigger problem of this roster currently. Ryan is 
  one or two more major injuries away from being very wing clipped. 
  All three of his IR spots are occupied by Wilson, Pacioretty, and 
  Landeskog. If, for example, Forsberg is out for a few games, Ryan 
  has no choice but to either ride with 2 goalies, lose Forsberg to
  free agency - one where goalies are at a premium right now, or lose 
  one of those guys he has stashed in IR to keep Forsberg.", 
      br(),br(),
      "It is worth noting that Mike has a similar problem in that he has 
  Laine, Buchnevich, and Ehlers currently on IR and is also
  one or two more injuries away from making some tough decisions. These
  two teams are staring down the issue that Strez has encountered for most 
  of his time in this league and if that team's history is any
  indication of how a crowded IR can hurt, both Mike and Ryan can 
  find themselves taking on water without a bucket as the season unfolds.",
