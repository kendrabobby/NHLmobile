    "Hockey is officially back. We’re past (a shortened) week one and the sprint 
to the VHL playoffs have officially begun. Last week I made some predictions 
as to who would draw first blood in the matchups and y’know, I didn’t do half bad. 
I thought Darin had a good week and he actually went above my expectations. 
I figured he would best Mike by a narrow margin of 10 points and he did in 20. 
Strez met his goal of blowing out Chris. I said he’d do it by at least 20 points, 
he did it by 45. Already a strong showing for the incumbent champ. Craig, never 
missing an opportunity to defy me, beat Travis narrowly. I thought Travis
would have outshined him this week and I was proven wrong. These two were the 
closest matchup and the most fun one to watch. Nick lined up with my thoughts 
by shellacking Ryan by 30 points. So that leaves us with two Anthracite Teams 
and two Steel teams with wins. An even split in the standings. ",
    br(),
    tags$h4("Nick"),
    "1.	Nick’s decision to stick with Vasi was never going to be put into question given his 
    and Tampa Bay’s pedigree, and I even remarked about how Vasi was going to be big 
    for him in week 1. But his other goalie is no slouch either. Nick’s acquisition 
    of Islanders’ Varlamov netted him a shutout going into week 2. If Bob can return
    and play at the level that he is known for, it might appear that Nick has a top 
    3 goalie tandem in our league. ",
    br(),
    "2.	Speaking of Tampa, their explosiveness against Chicago was one of the main reasons 
    why he soared by Ryan in week 1. It remains to be seen if it will be the same case 
    this week, however, as they are set to square off against Columbus who, in very 
    recent history, has given them plenty of trouble. Conversely, Columbus has been 
    struggling lately, barely getting by Detroit in their season opener. Tampa’s players 
    are too good to be kept off the scoresheet and will still produce but I don’t know 
    if it will be at the extreme level they did last week.",
    br(),
    "3.	I had to laugh after Farabee had his superb opening game against the Pens. I think
    Nick scooped him up before that game even ended. It might have been a mush, though,
    as he has remained scoreless since then. ",
    br(),
    "4.	Tampa players aside, it is going to be hard to beat Nick when he’s employing Drai 
    and Mark Stone. Both players are cornerstones of their franchises and are among 
    his top producing guys last week. ",
    
    tags$h4("Craig"),
    "5.	A large reason why Craig snuck by Travis this week was due to the last game of week 1. Huberdeau, Ekblad,
    and Hornqvist came through for Fischer in their game against Chicago on Sunday. It’s beginning to look like whoever’s
    players are lacing up against Chi-town that week will enjoy a nice points boost. I don’t think his three players’ performances on 
    Sunday were indicative as Florida being a good squad, but as Chicago being a complete dumpster fire.",
    br(),
    "6.	Craig has an interesting decision to make as of this writing as Kapanen is due to play against Washington. 
    Kap is currently on Craig’s IR, so, I wonder who he drops for the Swede. It’s interesting that his two lowest point producers to date are Kakko and Lafreniere. 
    He won’t drop those. It’ll likely be Spurgeon. Voracek is a candidate but his pedigree is too high to just simply let go. ",
    br(),
    "7.	The Couture and Kane spots on this team were the most producing. The two players are set to play 
    St. Louis and Minny this week, though, so, they might slow down a smidge. ",
    br(),
    "8.	I imagine it was stressful times earlier last week when Grubauer let in 4 goals before getting the hook against St. Louis. 
    There was already a question mark around Matt Murray and Craig couldn’t afford another one with another goalie. He bounced back and pitched a shutout the very 
    next game, though. Craig can rest easy. ",
    
    tags$h4("Strez"),
    "9.	Boy oh boy is it going to be hard to beat Strez with Matthews, Mackinnon, and Svech on this team. 
    This squad would have hit 300 points in a shortened week if Kuch was allowed to shine against Chicago. The rest of the VHL are collectively sighing relief knowing 
    that he will be on IR the entire season. ",
    br(),
    "10.	I don’t get to watch a lot of Vegas games due to time slots but Shea Theadore likes to rip it. 
    I watched one powerplay last night and he had easily about 4 shot attempts from the blueline.
    All heavy shots. He has 12 SOG to date. That doesn’t count attempts. He’ll collect assists 
    for Strez but he’ll also be a good producer for half points for every shot he has on net. ",
    br(),
    "11.	Little Jack Hughes is shaping up. He had 3 apples last week for Strez. We all better hope that 
    the 2019 1OA doesn’t start figuring it out this year otherwise 
    that can be another nice weapon in the Pounder’s arsenal. ",
    br(),
    "12.	Assuming he doesn’t prove to be a streaky player,  Nick Suzuki was a beast for Strez in the opening round. 
    He looked good in the playoffs last summer but he has the chance to string together a beautiful season for the Habs who, by the way, look to be ahead of schedule 
    in their rebuild. In Strez’ case, the rich get richer. ",
    
    tags$h4("Darin"),
 "13.	Darin’s path to victory was partially through the crease. Andersen, Lehner, and Markstrom netted (pun intended) him 3 wins, including a shutout by Markstrom. 
    Lehner had another start last night to kick off week 2 and was yet another win. Andersen, however, was the weak link.  Letting in 5 goals and posting a .792 save
    percentage against Ottawa. Even his opener against Montreal, while still a win, saw him only saving 87.5% of all shots seen. I wonder when Toronto considers a 
    possible trade. ",
 br(),
 "14.	Taylor Hall is definitely enjoying the change in scenery in Buffalo. He had 3 points in week 1 and then 3 points yesterday alone. Hall was a bit of a downer 
    last year for Darin but it looks like the corner has been turned and will be a viable option for Darin week in and week out. ",
 br(),
 "15.	John Tavares and Mitch Marner were electric for Gipe, even despite that stinker against Ottawa. As long as those two are rolling, Darin doesn’t need Matthews 
    to enjoy the fruits of the Leaf’s labor. ",
 br(),
 "16.	Don’t look now but Kessel has three goals in three games. A lot of people in both the NHL and 
    the fantasy world were very skeptical of Kessel last year and wondered if he has finally ridden
    over the hill. It may be a temporary flash, but, Darin welcomed it to ensure his first win of 
    this short fantasy season.",
    
 tags$h4("Chris"),
 "17.	The Kevin Hayes revolving door continues for Chris. He has added and dropped Hayes at least twice 
    so far and we’re only 6 days in. He should have sticking power on the team as he is the 1C in
    Philly but Chris apparently can’t make up his mind.",
br(),
"18.	The counterpart to Hall, Eichel is likely enjoying having an active participant on his line as opposed to a passenger. Eichel has 6 assists on the season and 
    has done so against stiff competition. ",
br(),
"19.	The more that I look at it, the more that I like Fleury being his 3rd goalie. It’s evident that 
    teams aren’t going to rely heavily on their starters this year (aside from maybe Tampa) so, 
    Fleury getting spot starts, probably against favorable matchups, might actually work for Vargo. ",
"20.	It’s becoming evident that Chris is going to forego a crucial spot on his roster to house Byfield 
    until next year. If Chris goes on a bit of a losing streak, however, one has to think he may 
    release him. It’s worth keeping an eye on. ",

tags$h4("Travis"),
"21.	Another week, another Penguin for Travis. Seeing the need for some minor tweaks, he has picked up Tanev from 
    Pittsburgh. While I normally would laugh, I am actually applauding this move as it seems that Tanev might 
    be a decent contributor to the Penguins’ offense. ",
br(),
"22.	McDavid has only had goals in one game. It was a hat trick for him last week but aside from that he hasn’t seen 
    the back of the net, even against Montreal’s backup netminder. This is a non-story, McDavid is fine, he’s not 
    slumping. But I think his spotty production is a product of the personnel around him. Edmonton might take a
    step back this year, which will burn yet another year of the Greatest in the game’s career.",
br(),
"23.	Back to the Pittsburgh thing, though. Travis currently has 5 players from Pittsburgh’s roster on his team. 
    I am commenting on this due to the Pens potentially being a big regression candidate for the year. If all 
    of these players are all having down years we can expect Travis to as well. Until, of course, he makes 
    some moves. ",
br(),
"24.	Much like Chris, it appears Travis is holding out for Zegras next year. I spoke to GM Ryan regarding this,
    for a quick scouting report, and he commented that Zegras will likely be called up later in the year. But 
    when? If it’s at the tail end of the season… is the juice worth the squeeze?",

tags$h4("Ryan"),
"25.	Some top guys on Ryan’s squad have an Out status for week 2. Couturier and Laine. It appears that both 
    injuries are relatively short term but given that Ryan was the lowest scoring team in the opening week, 
    he needs all of the help he can get. Ryan’s trademark is making smart waiver pickups from players you’ve 
    never heard of, so, I don’t doubt that he can save face… but it doesn’t make the situation any less fortunate.",
br(),
"26.	You have to think that Ryan is trying to cook up a way to dislodge Svech from Strez’s clutches to compliment 
    Aho who share a 1st PP unit in Carolina. ",
br(),
"27.	Speaking of aforementioned “players you’ve never heard of,” Ryan’s addition of Romanov in Montreal is a good one. The Chiclets boys had a few minute 
    blurb about this electric player who finds himself on the 2nd PP unit up there in Quebec, but will be trying to move on up in the roster. ",
br(),
"28.	Khudobin being sidelined with Dallas until they are cleared to play is part of the reason why Ryan didn’t stack up like 
    he normally does, but I predict that the late start against teams that have had more than a week to warm up might see 
    Khudobin having some rough starts for a little while. Hopefully Gibson and Darcy Kuemper can buoy Ryan’s netminding 
    categories for the time being. Credit Gibson for the shutout last night. ",

tags$h4("Mike"),
"29.	Mike’s gamble to keep Shesterkin over the offseason didn’t pan out in week one. Shesty got picked apart in the 
    home opener against the Islanders. Then Price got picked apart by Toronto in their home opener. Saros is the 
    only bright spot in net for Mike at the moment. ",
br(),
"30.	Mike acquired Reinhart for some help after Stutzle was deemed out for Ottawa. A shame for Tim “Jimmy” Stutzle
    as he is a top candidate for the Calder this year. Mike hopes that he isn’t out for long but hopefully Reinhart
    can keep producing alongside Eichel and Hall, both who have been commented on in this article. ",
br(),
"31.	It seems that the only Tampa Bay player who didn’t enjoy a big bag of points in week one was Sergachev. 
    Serg has dropped to the 3rd pairing and 2nd PP unit on a stacked team. ",
    br(),
"32.	Mika Zibanejad was another keeper of Mike’s going into 2021. Mika has had a bit of a slow start which is understandable 
    as he had just recovered from covid and missed most of training camp. If Mike is going to start winning, he needs his
    top C to start rounding back to form. ",
br(),
br(),

"There are plenty of storylines going into this week and beyond. Can Darin be this 
    year’s Strez? Zero to hero? He is currently trading blows with Strez as we speak. 
    They are separated by a singular point. Is Ryan’s week one performance an early 
    warning sign for regression? Hold the phones on that – he almost put up 100 points
    on Monday alone. This week features divisional matchups. Travis is hoping he 
    doesn’t go down 0-2-0 this week as that will equal a 2 game gap behind Nick. 
    Same can be said for Ryan in his matchup against Craig. Chris and Mike are 
    fighting for their first win, two men enter, one man leaves with a dub.
    Darin and Strez are fighting for the top spot in the Anthracite division. 
    These standings are more valuable than last year given the shortened season. 
    A 0-2 hole can really damage a team’s chances at playoffs.",
