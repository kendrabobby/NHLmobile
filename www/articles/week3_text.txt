After 2 weeks we are starting to see some separation in our league. Strez 
is now the only team in the VHL who is undefeated and is doing so in convincing 
fashion. With that said, Mike is the only GM trying to find his first win 
but it's not looking like it will come easy. This week he is due to face 
off against the aforementioned undefeated Strez team and Mike wasn't
exactly an offensive dynamo in his week 2 loss to Chris. The rest of 
the league, meanwhile, are all sitting pretty at a win a piece. No one 
is in any real danger to lose ground this week out of the remaining 6 teams.

<b> Strez </b>
<line break>
<line break>
1. I remarked last week on how Strez's team is loaded with talent, 
but it is sort of bonkers that Strez was the second highest scoring last week
without much help from Svech, who only tallied 9 Fpts in the matchup. 
The production can be credited to Makinnon and Matthews, for sure,
but we can't ignore the work that Jack Hughes, Shea Theadore, and Oliver
Bjorkstrand did. All over 20 fpts for the week. If Jack Hughes has a break
out season for Strez, it's game over for everyone. Week 1 it was Suzuki, 
week 2 brings Hughes... anyone want to take bets on the next young player
on Strez's squad to start blowing up? 
<line break>
2. I see that Strez has finally seen the light regarding known NHL
stud Kevin Hayes. He added him late last week due to to Jumbo going down.
<line break>
3. I wonder how long Jake Debrusk's leash is on Strez' squad? He's a Bruin,
so I imagine longer than most, but he has only 1 apple on the season and
that is with him being on the first line AND 2nd PP. Strez's team is
humming on all cylinders... there's no room for passengers this year.
<line break> 
4. Bad luck having Blackwood go down due to COVID protocol. That dude 
was owning the net in Jersey, The Koskinen pick up, though, holds merit. 
Strez's goalie squad is shaping up to be a "win-by-committee," there aren't
any real work horses there. You can argue Binnington, but, I think he's been
human since the Cup Run two years ago. Either way, all 4 goalies that Strez
is employing have been decent enough. No worries there. Just need to stay
healthy.
<line break>
<line break>
<b>Ryan</b>
<line break>
<line break>
5. Rumors of Ryan Lennon's demise have been greatly exaggerated. In week 1 
he looked rather pedestrian, but, in true Ryan fashion, he exploded back 
this week and was the league's highest scorer. How? Let's start with his 
goalies. Gibson posted a shutout early on in the week against Minnesota
and then stole a win against Colorado Sunday night. Khudobin, after a 
long rest, picked up a pair of wins for Dallas. and the Darce down in
Arizona stole one against Vegas and only allowed 1 GA in his loss Saturday. 
People underestimate the production that good goalie tandems can be in our
league but his goalies accounted for almost 20% (18.3%) of his points 
accumulated this week. 
<line break>
6. With Laine out of Winnipeg, Ryan's players will shine even more, I
suspect. Scheifele and Connor both had great weeks but they will now see 
more icetime and more opportunity now that Laine is no longer "the guy"
there. might have been a 4D chess move when he drafted them, knowing 
full well Laine was not long for the 'Peg. But I may be giving him too 
much credit.
<line break>
7. Brent Burns decided to turn back the clock a little by posting 30
fpts for Ryan this week including a highlight reel goal against Minny
on Saturday night. Burns is still proving to be a points machine, Ryan 
will be harder to deal with because of it.  
<line break>
8. I saw a report earlier this morning that the Pettersson, Boeser, Miller
line is among the second lowest line in the NHL regarding expected goals 
for regarding lines playing over 25 minutes a night (so, the Fantasy relevant 
ones). While Ryan's team isn't necessarily dependant on Pettersson producing 
right now, it still is a little concerning. I don't believe that that line, 
and in turn - this player, will stay low on the scoring chart for long... but
until they turn a corner, they're certainly on watch. 
<line break>
<line break>
<b>Darin</b>
<line break>
<line break>
9. Darin seems to have a team that is bookended by high producing 
players and very low producing players... at least, in week 2. 
Bo Horvat, Mitch Marner, John Tavares, Connor Murphy and Hall are all 
players that produced at a very high level in the last 7 days. Bo even 
had a 30 point week. 
<line break>
10. But then you have Gaudreau, Kessel, Burakovsky (just returned from 
injury), Edler, Chabot, Karlsson, Barrie all of which produced less than
12 fpts a piece. Darin lost this week and it certainly should be 
attributed to the off weeks that a third of his roster had. Some of these
names are of no cause for concern... but a few are troubling. Looking at you
Kessel and Johnny Hockey.
<line break>
11. Taylor Hall continues to be a storyline for me. He has found new life
in Buffalo and is continuing to be a shining star on Darin's roster. He
isn't lighting the lamp yet but he has been much more noticeable on Buffalo
and I suspect that the points will start rolling in.  
I continue to applaud Darin for holding on to him as I know he was sought 
after during trade talks last year.
<line break>
12. I wonder how the power struggle between Lehner and Fleury is going to
shake out after Fleury's shutout win the other night. Lehner had a stinker
against Arizona the other night, letting in 4 goals in a loss. Something
to watch if you're Darin. Might even be a "sell while you can," candidate. 
<line break>
<line break>
<b> Nick </b>
<line break>
<line break>
13. Nick lost this week but just barely. The loss can somewhat be directly
linked to Tampa Bay being sidelined due to COVID vs Dallas. Stamkos, Point,
 Hedman and Vasi all were shelved for Nick early this week and he still 
almost won. Continuing on, when Tampa did play against CBJ, they struggled 
mightily which may be attributed to them having to sit for almost a week 
prior. If I'm Nick, I don't get discouraged by this loss, however, it is a
good example of how rosters should (or should not) be constructed this year. 
<line break>
There are a couple of rosters in our league that glommed on to a specific 
team and took their best players. In theory, this is probably fine, so long
as the team in question is playing well. But, what if the entire team is
forced to sit out due to postponements? Then you're out a good chunk
of roster players and you're out of any real options. You know the players
are coming back, so, there's no way you can drop them temporarily. 
Nick's loss brings along with it an interesting thing to munch over as
the season develops. GM's might be wise to spread their rosters out among
more teams in the NHL to "COVID" proff themselves. 
<line break>
13.b. I'm aware that Tampa played CBJ twice this week and that they 
weren't completely inhibited by COVID. But looking at their scheduling
and them having to sit out against Dallas, was what got me to thinking
about roster makeup and COVID influences on our teams this year.  
<line break>
14.  Draisaitl had a beautiful buzzer beater the other night against the 
'Peg. Leon has been a revelation since last season and adds a whole new
element to Nick's Tampa Bay heavy team. 
<line break>
15. I have to imagine Nick is losing his patience with Tony Deangelo. 
If he's not being scratched for throwing tantrums on the ice, he's out there
fumbling the puck and not producing on the Power Play. Look for him on 
the waiver wire soon
<line break>
16. Vasi's absence this week wasn't felt due to Varly picking up some
monstrous slack on Long Island. Two wins and a shutout kept Nick buoyed
enough to go to-to-toe with Travis this week. 
<line break>
<line break>
<b> Chris </b>
<line break>
<line break>
17. The Yin to Darin's goalie Yang, Chris is likely very ecstatic that 
Fleury is making a strong case to reclaim the starter's crease in Vegas.
<line break> 
18. Blake Wheeler and Anze Kopitar both hit the 30 Fpts in a week mark
in week 2. Wheeler is no surprise but Kopi is proving to doubters that he 
is still viable in fantasy formats and in LA. The fact that he was drafted
in the 22nd round of our draft should make everyone feel foolish.
<line break> 
19. Don't look now but McAvoy is being underwhelming in fantasy again. 
<line break>
20. What in the world is going on with Carter Hart? He has been letting in 
goals by the bucket load. He had two negative point nights this week and 
the night that he actually posted points he still let in 4 goals. 
<line break>
<line break>
<b> Travis </b>
<line break>
<line break> 
21. Kudos to Travis for picking up the red hot Tyler Toffoli. While 
Travis didn't get to enjoy all 43 of the Fpts that Tyler put up in week 2, 
he still managed to squeeze 18.5 since the pick up on Thursday. Does he 
keep it up? Was it just a hot streak? We'll continue to monitor the 
situation. 
<line break>
22. Travis' goalies are dropping like flies. Samsonov is out for Covid,
Talbot is DTD with a LBI. Luckily, Hellebuyck has been picking up some wins
and his addition to Kaapo Kahkonen, whom I believe is just Kaapo Kakko 
with an evil moustache, should keep his goalie points up for the time being. 
<line break>
23. As mentioned with Nick (read: Thought 13), Travis has many Penguins
on his roster. Typically I would poke fun at this fact but I am now musing
over the potential for Travis to dip production wise should COVID sweep
through the Pens organization. Diversify, Travis. 
<line break>
24. Looking at the totals this week, it appears that Travis' method of 
victory was less "individual performances," and more "everyone just score
sometimes." This is especially incredible given that he employs McDavid. 
But almost everyone on this team scores somewhere in the teens. Connor 
himself only posted 23 Fpts for the week. Can winning continue if his team
performs like this? Probably. It won't win any championships, but he'll
certainly go .500. 
<line break>
<line break>
<b>Craig</b> 
<line break>
<line break> 
25. Craig lost big this week. To the tune of close to 100 points. Part of
the discrepency was that it was against Ryan who shit kicked the league 
in points. But what else is going on here? 
<line break>
26. Some of the problems has nothing to do with team talent. Florida 
was due to play Carolina who has been sidelined due to Covid. So none of 
those players got to play. Craig has 3 Panthers and One Hurricane on his 
lineup. Huberdeau is a massive point getter but was only restricted to one 
game this week against Chicago. Teravainen is a big one from the Canes and 
he hasn't played at all. 
<line break>
27. Next, injuries and quarantines. Pasta is skating with Boston but isn't 
slated to return yet. Pasta was Craig's biggest producer last year. It's no 
surprise that production is down when your "x-factor" is shelved. PLD
has been traded to Winnipeg, so, he must sit out for quarantining reasons. 
This will affect Craig's bottom line for another week or so as well. 
<line break>
28. Craig's now notorious penchant to snag Rangers lottery picks are
starting to bite him a bit. Both Kakko and Lafreniere are due to be big 
name players in the NHL. The question is... when? Some lottery picks
blossom right before our eyes: look at Matthews or Laine. Others... 
well, take some time. Mackinnon had a decent first year and then fell off
the radar for about 2.5 seasons after before he blew up. Both Kakko and 
Laf have the tools to break out... but they're still both only 19, playing
in a weird season, with shortened training camps, no preseason games, etc. 
The case can be made that they will be huge for Craig... eventually. But 
it might not be this year, or next year, or even the year after that. 
But not right now. Both Kakko and Laf combined for 8.5 points this week. 
<line break>
<line break>
<b>Mike</b>
<line break>
<line break> 
29. Mike sits in a 0-2 hole after week 2 and has the improbable task of 
beating Strez for his first W of the season. Can he? Will he? 
<line break>
30. He needs Ovechkin back. The bad news is that Ovi won't be back until
at the very earliest, Saturday, the 30th. So, that leaves him with one game
against Boston to put up points. 
<line break>
31. He needs Zbad to start being Zbad. The Zibanejad line in NY has gone
scoreless in the last two games against Pit. The good news, though, is that
the Rangers play Buffalo twice and Pit once in week 3. Buffalo is proving to 
be tougher than anticipated, sure, but it should give Z some opportunity 
to start cooking. 
<line break>
32. He needs goalie help. Shesty has looked shaky in his last two starts. 
Saros gave him a net -1.5 points this week and Price was a sieve against
Vancouver. Mike's skaters can put up 25 points a week but it won't mean 
much if the crease isn't taken care of. My bet is that Mike goes another 
week winless.
