"I would like to take a minute and thank you all for being accomodating 
regarding my absence from the league for the last week or so. I try to
provde you guys with a regular stream of content but... my scheduling
was, as you can imagine, pretty rough. But I'm back in the saddle now
and here to comment on the league once again, let's see where we're at. ",
br(),br(),
"Travis trounced Mike in week 5 and continues his trajectory upward. Mike,
however, got lucky as it looked like he stayed put in the standings. ",
br(),br(),
"A surprising win from Craig has inhibited Strez from moving up the ladder. 
Strez now has lost a few in a row to lower teams. Big momentum bilder for
Craig. ",
br(),br(),
"Nick blew Chris out of the water by over 100 points. Chris needs to find 
some answers fast. This season is starting to get away from him. ",
br(),br(),
"Darin continues to impress and beat Ryan this week. Last year's bottom 
seed is giving off real 2019-2020 Strez vibes thus far. Let's see if he can
keep it up. ",

br(),
tags$h4(" Nick "), 

"1. Quick. If I asked you who scored more fantasy points for Nick last week
Malkin or Drai, who would you say. A good bettor would say Drai, but Malkin 
actually brought home more for Nicky G. Both barely produced anything but,
it is still an interesting footnote. Malkin has been lost this year and
Drai has gone uncharacteristically cold. ",
br(),br(),
"2. Despite those two big guns slacking, Nick was the points leader last 
week. How? Tampa Bay. Hedman, Stammer, Point and Vasi netted him over 
100 points on their own. As long as they eat, so does Nick. ",
br(),br(),
"3. Nick's other goalies provided some much needed firepower as well. 
Varly got a shutout and Bob grabbed two wins. Those three goaltenders have
super high potential and add an underrated element to Nick's lineup. ",
br(),br(),
"4. John Gabriel Pageau has entered the battlefield. He had almost 30 points
last week and had a breezy 2 goal night the other night. ",

br(),
tags$h4(" Darin "),

"5. Darin is second in the league currently but, unlke Nick, it looks like 
covid has affected him a least a little. Taylor Hall, a supposed cornerstone
for this team didn't play any games and netted him a fat 0 in the points 
section. ",
br(),br(),
"6. The same can be said for any of the Colorado players he has employed. 
They were required to sit and Darin was required to deal with it. Luckily, 
Darin doesn't have any of the AV's big guns on his team... so the loss 
wasn't as badly felt as other teams like Strez (Mackinnon), Ryan (Rantanen),
or Mike (Makar, Byram). ",
br(),br(),
"7. Brady Tkachuk and Chychrun were Darin's big contributors this week, 
which is interesting and likely the only time Chychrun has had that
written about him in the last few years. ",
br(),br(),
"8. Markstrom and Andersen both chipped in more than 20 points for Dare 
Bear and it is a small part of a point that I want to make. I think, given 
the way that covid is ravaging American teams, the ticket to making 
ground in the standings lies with Canadian team players. Both of these 
goalies play for Canadian squads and enjoyed the max number of starts. 
Until covid creeps into the North Division (if it ever does), I think
a wise move would be take advantage of those free agents who may still be
available... at least while your starters are sitting in IR due to 
being on covid protocol. ",

br(),
tags$h4(" Travis "),

"9. Not a whole lot of 20+ scorers this week for Travis but not many 
sub 10 scorers either. No, almost every player contributed a mid range 
of points this week in Travis' win against Mike and if you're Travis
you are pretty pumped about that. If that remains consistent and then 
one or two players pop off during a matchup... that's a recipe for a
successful season. ",
br(),br(),
"10. More good news for Travis going into week 6 is that aside from Motte
and Krug (IR, DTD, respectively), his team is looking healthier than 
most. This bodes well for the middle parts of this shortened season. ",
br(),br(),
"11. Justin Faulk has been great for Travis this year. I feel like Faulk 
is consistently underrated but it does seem that this year he is enjoying
St. Louis and was a sneaky goo addition for \"Da Snake\"",
br(),br(),
"12. The goalie carousel on this team has been fun to watch. Kevin Lankinen
of Chicago was Travis' best goalie in week 5 and you're all lying to me
if you say that you knew who that guy was. ",

br(),
tags$h4(" Ryan "),

"13. If Travis had a lot of people contributing a few handfuls of points
for his team last week, then Ryan had a lot of people contributing... 
a handful? of points. Rantanen you can understand... due to covid layoffs. 
But Kyle Connor and Nuge Hopkins all had 3 GP and could barely contribute
a pot to piss in. ",
br(),br(),
"14. Brent Burns and Pettersson had 3 GP and barely got 10 Fpts aside. Ryan's 
team is slumping for sure... but, the things tend to always regress to the 
average and I don't think Ryan will be held off for long. ",
br(),br(),
"15. I don't know who Mario Ferraro is... but, Ryan didn't like him 
as he only lasted about 9 days on the roster. A sign that Lennon likely 
isn't going to stand pat with this team that seems to only be treading 
water. ",
br(),br(),
"16. I wonder how long Khudobin is going to be on this team considering 
Dallas seems to never play and the rookie, Oettinger, seems to be
rounding to expected form. Ryan has pride, so, he will likely hold on to 
him and try to make his notorious high draft pick work. ",

br(),
tags$h4(" Mike "),
  
  
"17. Given the pedigree of goalies Mike has... it is so strange to see
none of them produce any real chunk of points, or even play. Shesterkin 
and Price were the only two goalies to get starts for Mike in week 5 and 
they only produced about 9 points each. It looks like Mike is still
trying to figure out his third goalie as that has been a bit of a revolving 
door. Mike Smith didn't impress in his first start on the team, but, he
has been hot. ",
br(),br(),
"18. It's clear that Mike is attempting to diversify but it is also clear 
that he has that homer bias that we have seen from Nick(Tampa) and Travis
(Pittsburgh). Mike currently had Zbad, Fox, Shesty, and aquired Kakko from
his recent trade with Craig. The damning part is that some of those players
aren't even producing. ZBad has been ice cold, Kakko still hasn't been
the force that Rangers fans had hoped. You wonder if Mike starts to look
for some trades to balance out the team. ",
br(),br(),
"19. Mike took a flyer on Erik Karlsson who has not had much success in 
San Jose the last few years. There was a time that EK could have been
liquidated in this league for a bevy of players and now he can be had for 
free on the waiver wire. Whats worse is that he immediately got injured
after Mike claimed him. ",
br(),br(),
"20. Makar being out for this long is definitely hurting Mike. This fact
plus Barkov being nonexistent in his last 3 games is likely why the 
score in week 5 was not as close as it should have been. ",

br(),
tags$h4(" Craig "),

"21. Who knew that Craig had it in him. Who knew that Craig's team was 
capable of taking it to the house against Strez last week. Who knew 
that Craig was going to employ 6 goalies to do it. ",
br(),br(),
"22. I haven't dug into the \"why\" but, it's true. Craig enlisted Korpi,
Grubauer, Allen, Oettinger, Rask, and Halak at various points during 
his week against Strez and was awareded with 41.75 points because of it. 
Granted, note that only Rask and Halak netted him over 5 points in their
performances. The other 6 averaged around 4 points each. ",
br(),br(),
"23. Bad luck for PLD. Finishes quarantine for Winnipeg and then gets hurt. ",
br(),br(),
"24. It just seems like certain players revolve around certain GM's. 
When I think of Nick, I think Stamkos. Ryan? Laine. Am I crazy for saying
that Craig's \"Spirit Animal\" is Hornqvist? Horny was the only player
on Craig's team to contribute over 20 points in his win against Strez. ",

br(),
tags$h4(" Strez "),
  
"25. Someone needs to get Strez a new ladder as he has tumbled pretty far
down this one in the last two weeks. Why? This team is too good so what 
gives? Kucherov being out for the entire year is having a cascading
effect on this team. Let's face it, Strez isn't going to cut bait on Kuch
just because he has an injury. So, on the IR Kuch is stashed. But what 
happens when other players are deemed unfit to play? ",
  br(),br(),
"26. In the last few weeks, Mackinnon, Landeskog, Risto and a few others
all weren't able to play and were IR eligible. With Kuch taking a much 
needed spot in IR, Strez only had one spot to play with. Naturally, due to
there being more unfit players than IR spots, Strez had less \"buying 
power\", when it came to grabbing replacements to bolster his production
while his starters were out. He had injured players sitting on his active
roster and was unable to do much about it. ",
br(),br(),
"27. The problem expands when one of his goalies gets hurt. Blackwood actually
took his second IR spot and is still there. Next, Ullmark has been 
sidelined due to Buffalo's covid issues. So, now you're lacking 
production from your elite group of skaters and your goalies are 
wingclipped. ",
br(),br(),
"28. The Icing on the cake that Strez served to Craig last week was that the
depth players - Suzuki, Benn, Theodore, Bjorkstrand. All good players
in their own right... but they also slumped in the games that they 
actually got to play. Dems the breaks, and Strez knows it. But, I think he
also knows what he has with his team and is likely a little grateful
that many of the elite members of it have moved past the COVID thing 
early on. It would have been a shame to see this happen in the playoffs. ",

br(),
tags$h4(" Chris "),

"29. You gotta feel for Chris. No one thought his team would be this much 
of a wash this early on. Is it hopeless? No. He finds himself 1 W behind 
Mike and Strez. But as highlighted in the preious thought, no one
expects Strez to be laying on his back for too long. What should Chris do? 
Keep Fleury, sell Holtby. Fleury has been a monster for Chris this year
and has dethroned Lehner in Vegas. But Holtby has been bad. Like... 2 wins
in 4 weeks bad. Carter Hart is coming back due to Philly snapping out 
of their COVID streak but... Hart and Flower can only keep that ship afloat
for so long. Find a goalie. ",
br(),br(),
"30. Make some moves. the Sergachev pick up was a savvy one. Serg hasn't 
been crazy good this year but he has been steadily picking up assists 
in almost every game in the last week or so. Who else should Chris target?
  Cam Atkinson is a steady target who has been good the last week or so. 
William Nylander has been released into the wild recently. He has some 
low ris, high reward potential. Kyrou has been sneaky good for St. Louis. ",
br(),br(),
"31. But what else? Cut bait on players like Strome and Killorn. They're
household names due to their teams and linemates... but they themselves 
live and die when their usually better partners go cold. They don't
contribute much to the play of their lines and are passengers. Warm bodies
to stopgap a hole in a roster. ",
br(),br(),
"32. Be patient. Eichel is back. Kane and the Blackhawks are good again? 
  Giroux and Konecny are due to be back soon. Maybe sell high on Farabee. 
Werenski might be out long term too. He can be dropped for a suitable 
replacement. ",
