"    It appears that a new challenger has entered the battlefield for league
    leader. For the first time in Darin's carrer in the VHL, he has risen to 
top spot in the standings. His ascension parallels that of Strez's a year
    ago; end the previous season in the dredges only to quickly turn it 
    around in the subsequent year. He has had some convincing wins so far:
      a 288 to 245 win against Nick in week 6, a 266.75 to 245.75 win against Mike
    in week 1, and he has had a few close calls too. The bottom line is, his 
    team is really clicking and it's encouraging for the health of the league
that new contenders make themselves known. ",
br(), br(),
"Conversely, Strez has had a fall from grace. He currently sits in 7th 
above only Chris. Of course, this isn't wholly indicative of the skill
    of his team, no; the state of his team can be directed to untimely 
    injuries, COVID postponements, and even weather delays. We are currently 
    at the halfway mark (playoffs not counted) and it is crucial that he and
    some other teams figure it out before it is too late. ",

    in bunches and Darin is benefitting greatly due to it. Mitch Marner and
    Joh Tavares combined for 40.5 points last week for Darin. But their
    performances pale in comparison to another player from the North. ",

think I need to say much more here but It is very likely that Brady
himself was responsible for Darin's win. ",

      "3. I know that I have spoken of Hall and him seemingly finding his home
    alongside Eichel but it appears that this fantasy story does not have 
    a happy ending. Hall has been ice cold for Buffalo in the last few weeks
    and recent reports of Eichel potentially wanting out of Buffalo may see 
    Darin possessing a Taylor Hall who no longer is riding shotgun alongside
    Jack Eichel for the VHL playoffs.",
    br(), br(),
      "4. Some bad luck in the crease this week as both Andersen and Markstrom 
    went down and are currently DTD. Both goaltenders have been workhorses
    for their NHL squads and can cause a dip in Darin's point totals 
if ther are out for a long period of time. ",

When you have Conor Mcdavid on your team, and he puts up 41 points in one
week, you deserve to be near the upper crust. ",
br(), br(),
"6. The Panarin-Putin thing really will hurt Travis as Bread is as consistent
of a points getter as you're gonna get and now he is out for an undeterminable 
    amount of time. That 5.3 points per game is gonna hurt him, especially
    now that the Rangers have a decent chunk of games coming up. It appears
    that Travis picked up Boone Jenner as a stopgap which is a good move. He's
no Panarin but his 4.1 average will keep Travis afloat until Bread returns. ",

Travis 22 points which is a bit more than usual. If he starts waking up, 
that's good news for Da Snake. ",

      "8. It is a bit perplexing that Travis has held on to Samsonov up to this 
    point. Vanecek has had the lion's share of starts for WSH while Samsonov
has even been relegated to the AHL at one point. Sams is a good goalie
and has high potential but there's no real indication that he gets some
    decent amount of play anytime soon. ",

    No one except Pageau and Drai reached the 20 point plateau. Not that it 
    matters, he put up 100 points against Mike in the opening frame of week 7. ",
    br(), br(),

    during the matchups in week 6. Vasi netted 2 points, Stamkos - 6, 
    Point - 2.5, Hedman - 5.0. Safe to say that if Tampa isn't clicking, 
neither is Nick. ",

Nick.",

spot. ",

Yikes, I wonder how Torts likes that. Not that Ryan needed those points, 
he was one of two teams to get over 300 points... so, you can imagine how
lofty those heights can get if Laine was also clicking. No one thought
that Ryan was to be a bottom dweller all year, right? ",

going goalless for almost the entire month of Feb. It seems that Vancouver 
is starting to find the scoresheet more often, and that offense runs through
Petey. ",

    playing time and isn't expected to produce at the obscene levels of McDavid

a quality factor in Ryan's dub. ",

it would be wise for Craig to retain him after all. ",

    Kakko looked like he was poised for a bounty of points, especially after his
    shootout goal against Philly. Patience is a virtue... but, when does the 
    bait get cut? ",

him this week due to how unreliable he has been. ",

    isn't bad and he has enough time to climb up the standings but with Kuch
wasting space on his IR and other players just not doing it, you wonder
if Strez thinks big. ",

    P. Kane, Eichel, and JT Miller should be doing okay. But its the supporting 
    cast that is to blame. Pietrangelo was brought to Vegas to be THE guy 
    on the backend and so far he has been... mediocre. Joel Farabee finds the 
    net in gurts but he isn't consistent enough, the same goes for Strome and 
Killorn. ",

play for a while due to COVID and some of the bigger guns, all of which 
Chris employs (Giroux, Konecny) are still out. ",
