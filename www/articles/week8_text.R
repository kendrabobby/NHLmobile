"Somehow after the worst week the Anthracite division has endured, Darin 
still finds himself at the top of the standings, but just barely. 
Travis is nipping at his heels, has the same record, and is only 1.5
points behind Darin in the PF column. Darin's gonna need a win this week
to stay afloat.",
br(), br(),
"The rest of the Anthracite division is looking pretty abysmal. The 
remaining 3 teams have as many wins as their leader, Darin, among the 
lot of them. They need to really turn it around as we have officially
passed the halfway mark of the regular season. ",
br(), br(),
"Meanwhile, the Steel Division is as tight as ever. Travis and Nick are 
tied with 5 wins a piece while Ryan and Craig are just below them with
4 wins a piece. It is a safe bet to say that the eventual winner will 
likely come from the Western PA region. ",

tags$h4("Darin"),
"1. Roope Hintz and Denis Gurianov have a combined 10.5 points in the 
last 15 days. Some of this can be atributed to Dallas lengthly layoffs
due to weather conditions but... in the few games they have played, they
haven't produced. ",
br(), br(),
"  2. Good news for Darin as Tarasenko has been skating with the team and is
due back very soon. That will be a great boost for an already surging 
team. ",
br(), br(),
 " 3. Brady Tkachuk continues to be the backbone of Darin's team. He has over 
66 points in the last 2 weeks. He has 25 points in the last 7 days 
alone. Meanwhile, Johnny Hockey is slumping again... generating only 8
points in the last calendar week. ",
br(), br(),
"4. The one-two punch that is Tavares and Marner on this team is a solid one
and warrants some applause. It certainly helps that they share that first 
line in Toronto and they both man the top PP. ",

br(), 
tags$h4("Travis"),
"5. I bet Craig is punching himself for getting rid of Drake Batherson. 
Mid January when Craig grabbed him he had around 23.5 points and then 
by mid February when Travis took a flyer on him, he had ~55 points. Now? 
a scant week or two later? He has 115 points. Batherson is a true cautionary
tale to other GM's to be patient with young players. ",
br(), br(),
 " 6. I thought this was funny. Mike snagged up Zegras and Travis offered
to trade Kreider for him. Mike scoffed at the idea. Kreider gets a hattrick
the next day. Then gets a goal and an assist two days later. If Kreider
keeps this going, it'll be nice for Travis. Meanwhile, Zegras has been
pretty invisible in the fantasy world. EDIT: He has, upon further review,
looked comfortable out there and has been pretty flashy with the puck, 
so much so that he attempted a Michigan goal the other night... he 
still, however, is looking for his first point. ",
br(), br(),
"7. Torey Krug is likely becoming a source of frustration for Trav. The Dman
was brought into St. Louis to make up for the loss of Pietrangelo but
Faulk has been stealing the show (luckily, Travis also employs him). 
Krug hasn't been terrible, he averages 3.8 points a game... but still 
isn't where he should be given his pedigree. ",
br(), br(),
"8. Sean Couturier has exploded since coming back from his injury in Philly. 
Couts has been among Travis' top scorers and is currently on a 6 game 
point streak. ",

br(), 
tags$h4("Nick "),
  "9. Nick started out his matchup against Mike like a bat out of Hell putting
up a 100 spot on Day 1 and then never looked back. I don't think I've seen
an opening salvo so intense as that one in the more than half a decade
that this league has existed. It was terrifying. Currently, however, 
he is about 30 points back on Ryan in week 8. I don't expect that margin
to widen, though. It'll likely tighten as the weekend goes on. ",
br(), br(),
  "10. Nick kept the dream alive by getting 3 shutouts from his goalie. Two
from Vasi and 1 from Varly. With performances like that, he doesn't even 
need Bob to be stellar... he just needs him to be okay. EDIT: Vasi has
not let in a goal in 3 games... incredible work by the league's best 
tendy. ",
br(), br(),
  "11. In the \"not sustainable but definitely expected,\" category: Pageau
has been on a tear for the Islanders and is likely working his way up the 
roster on Long Island. 42 points in the last two weeks. ",
br(), br(),
  "12. Alex DeBrincat had himself a nice little weekend, he got himself 2G, 3A
good for 20.5 points in two days. Tidy business that helped stymie Mike's
comeback. ",

br(), 
tags$h4("Ryan"),
"13. It is on brand for Ryan that he got the rookie this year who has 
been the most impactful. Kaprizov is consistently on the highlight reels
and is providing good chunks of points for Ryan",
br(), br(),
"14. Laine had himself a night against Chicago last week with 2G's and an 
apple, good for 15.5 but has been held off the scoresheet since. This 
is old hat for Ryan and Laine's streakiness, of course, but I personally
would find it hard to work with a player as good as Laine who is so 
unreliable. He is currently pointless (goals and assists) in his last
four games. ",
br(), br(),
"15. Is there any timeline for Seguin's return? What is Ryan holding on
to him for? ",
  br(), br(),
  "16. As solid as Ryan's team is, that crease is looking terrible. The 
Darce is listed as \"OUT\" for the foreseeable future and Gibson hasn't
won a game since Feb 11th. The only shining light is Khudobin who got
himself a shutout last week. EDIT: it appears that he been moved to \"DTD\"
and might make an appearance this week... ",

br(), 
tags$h4("Craig"),
  "17. Bad luck for Craig this week as Crosby is out with COVID. Crosby 
isn't the backbone of this roster for Fischer but he is a consistent 
producer who averages 5 points a game. Crosby was slated to play 4 games
this week. That's a probably 20 point dip for Craig. 
Last minute edit: Sid is off the COVID list and can play against the Flyers
Thursday night. ",
br(), br(),
  "18. Lafreniere has shown some life for Craig. 4 points in his last 5 games
has shut up some of the naysayers... but he isn't the powerhouse that 
Craig has hoped he can be yet. He extended that point streak and will 
have a great chance to keep it going in his next two games against the 
slumping Devils. ",
br(), br(),
"19. Kris Letang has been on a bit of a run. He was on a 5 game point streak
until the Pens got shutout this weekend by the Islanders. That's a good 
sign and can be a good trade chip for Craig if he finds that he is in 
a position to do so toward the end of the season. ",
br(), br(),
  "20. I still can't believe that Hornqvist is averaging 5.9 points a game
and has solidified himself not only in Florida but on Craig's squad. ",

br(), 
tags$h4("Mike"),
  "21. One has to wonder when Zbad will be kicked off this team. It's becoming
a growing concern for Mike as the weeks tick by and nothing has been 
changing. ",
br(), br(),
"22. Sure, Kaprizov has been a boon for Ryan this year but Jimmy Stootz
is making a strong case to be that for Mike. He is currently collected
apples like hes Johnny Appleseed and has looked very comfortable in Ottawa. ",
br(), br(),
"23. Cale Makar being out has been a bummer for Mike. Arguably the best Dman 
on the roster and he has been either injured or flat out ineffective
recently. He is expected to potentially come back later on in the week. ",
br(), br(),
"24. If you needed a small example of how bad Mike's luck was during his 
matchup against Nick: Sunday afternoon, the Rangers play Boston. Georgiev 
is in net. Georgie gets hit, lets in a goal, and is immediately recalled 
for concussion protocol. Shesterkin enters the game. Shesty faces two shots
in his time on the ice before Georgie comes back. He saves one, lets in 
the other. Now... later on, the Rangers get a goal but ultimately lose. 
Since the Boston GWG was against Shesty, Shesty gets the loss... Mike
loses almost 2 points because of it - in a game where Shesty only saw 2 
shots. It didn't mean much, Mike still lost by over 50 points but it 
was a prime example of how bad his week went. ",

br(), 
tags$h4("Strez"),
"25. Can this year go any worse for Strez? Plagued with Injuries and COVID
and just as most of his team gets healthy, Matthews goes down. The coach
for Toronto claims that it isn't serious but... he has been held out of two
contests now. Not what Strez needed. EDIT: Matthews will draw back into 
the lineup against Vancouver tonight, however, now MacKinnon is DTD after
taking a pretty violent headshot in his game against San Jose Wednesday
night. The hits keep coming for the Polish Pounder. ",
br(), br(),
  "26. Aside from that... Most of his team is getting healthy. Hertl is on
the COVID list but he isn't by any means a cornerstone of this team. ",
br(), br(),
"27. He can use some help in the net. Koskinen has netted him a negative
2.25 points and Binnington has only yielded 7.5 in the last week. 
Blackwood has been good and can pick up two wins against the Rangers
Thursday and Saturday. ",
br(), br(),
"28. I still speculate if Strez is eyeing up trading a sidelined Kuch 
as a keeper chip for some immediate help. I suspect that when the season
starts to hit its last quarter and as long as Strez isn't in last place, 
he is going to gun for some moves. His roster is too good on paper to be
wasted and he knows it. ",

br(), 
tags$h4("Chris"),
  "29. Mike has to be kicking himself letting Nylander go. Chris' gain and a 
step in the right direction. Nylander has 45 points in the two weeks. ",
br(), br(),
"30. TK is healthy and waiting to come off the IR. I suspect that Chris will 
drop a much maligned Alex Killorn for the young Philly Forward. As he 
should. Dylan Larkin remains out and likely won't return for this week's 
matchup against Strez. ",
br(), br(),
"31. It almost seems criminal for Patrick Kane to be doing what hes doing
and exist on the roster that is occupying last place in the VHL. Kane
is currently providing MVP level production for both Chicago and Chris
and one has to hope that Chris finds the right combo to unleash him on
the rest of the league in the playoffs. ",
br(), br(),
"32. Given the state of the Anthracite division... Chris is by no means out
of the picture yet. He stands only 1 Win behind Mike and Strez for 2nd 
place and can still find his way into the playoffs. The roster he has
isn't bad and if a few players step up (Eichel, Marchessault, Holtby), 
we can see one of Strez or Mike sitting this one out come Spring. Chris
finds himself holding on to a very narrow lead currently against Strez.
Don't count Chris out yet. ",
