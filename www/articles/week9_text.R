    but as dangerous. Most of his players are clicking, including his

    Florida's surge forward this year, Bob has been solid. He is currently
    riding a 5 game Win streak",

    in producing offense for Nick.",

    for the playoffs (and remember, if the standings hold steady, Nick will 
    have a bye week in week 1), it can be the edge that Nick will need to

        for a bit during the middle portion of the matchup but Darin put on the
        afterburners during the weekend to leave his competition behind. The 
        lofty numbers that Darin saw this week isn't out of the norm but things
    were definitely bolstered by the return of Tarasenko. Stanko has put up

        recently. Both stars are capable of popping off at any time which makes
        Darin's week 9 316 point performance even more convincing given their
    lack of production during it. They combined for 9.5 points during the

    up insane numbers for Darin week in and week out. ",

    I do have one concern regarding his team and scheduling. Many of his marquis
    players, like the ones described in thought 7, are playing in the North
    Division of the NHL and have played many more games than the other 
    divisions in the NHL. I haven't looked into it thoroughly

    Craig is the victor of that deal. ",

    playoffs had he had stayed there. But, as he moves up the ladder, the 
    tougher the competition gets. His first test was Mike who proceeded to
    spank him by about 70 points. ",

    a death knell for Chris. Eichel wasn't exactly producing in Buffalo but
        he was still a 4.7 ppg player in our league. Anders Lee going on IR at 
        roughly the same time was the double whammy that Chris didn't need. 
    That's close to 10 ppg between the two players that Chris is going to 
        miss for a while. If both players play an average of 3 games a week... 
        That's ~30 points a week that Chris will be short of barring suitable

        try to sell for a player or two who can help immediately in his quest
        to get into the playoffs. All he has to do is sell the idea that Eichel

    For starters... aside from Kucherov, his team is healthy. The permanent
    Kucherov IR spot was a subject of discussion in one of my previous 
    articles because I believed that it created a cascading effect when more of
    his players went down. However, now that it looks like his squad is back
    we can expect an uptick in production. ",

    assists earlier on in the year but they have since cooled off. Hughes
    has one point (1G) in his last 7 games while Suzuki has been held off the
    scoresheet since March 6th. The potential in these two players is high
    however, as the season drags on and NHL competition gets tighter with 
    NHL playoff spots dwindling... we can expect these younger players to 
    regress due to the ice becoming smaller. Maybe Strez considers making a 
    trade for a more veteran producer to help bolster things. ",

    goalie who is producing wins and actually stopping oucks is Thatcher Demko. 
    Binnington hasn't had a win since 3/3 against ANA and Blackwood hasn't had 
    a win since 2/25 against BUF. Binnington also has a .875 SV% in the last
    week while Blackwood has a .871 SV%. There is a lot of room for improvement
    here and can be assessed from free agency. Mike Smith, for example, 
    continues to impress in Edmonton, rocking a .936 SV% and 2 wins last week. 
    Halak is slated to get the lion's share of starts while Tuuka is down. 
    There are options. ",

    is shipping Kucherov out, as a keeper, to a team that can stash him. 
    If you sell Kuch to a contender who has talent to spare, you can bolster 
    your production. Conversely, if Strez can identify a manager who may
    not believe that they are a true contender... why not ship Kuch out for
    one or two of their higher end players to help your team out immediately? ",
