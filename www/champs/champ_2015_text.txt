"Southern Comfort"

Nick was the first official champion of the VHL way back in 2015 and has deserved the recognition for the better part of the decade. Upon interviewing him about a potential chest, the players and teams he sought after mostly had the same theme: the dirty South. Awarded with a 2019 All-Star PK Subban Jersey, a vintage  1990's era Dallar Stars jersey, and a signed Victor Hedman puck - Nick now has the means to move below the Mason-Dixon and stake claim to one of the budding hockey towns growing down there.
